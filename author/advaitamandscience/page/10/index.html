<h3 style="text-align: center">       DVAITA   VIVEKA</h3>
<p style="text-align: left">Dvaita viveka is an important concept in Vedanta.  It helps one to understand the root of samsara (bondage to worldly life).  Dvaita viveka is well explained by Sri Vidyaranya Swami in his outstanding text Panchadasi.  Dvaita means seeing duality in the non-dual principle.  Dvaita is further divided as Ishwara dvaita and Jiva dvaita.  It is also said as jiva srishti and ishwara srishti.  This article explains the ishwara srishti and jiva srishti, its differences, how it binds a person and the division of jiva srishti.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Ishwara srishti</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Ishwara srishti (creation) is the outcome of maya undergoing various changes.  In the beginning there was only Brahman.  Brahman decided to become many.  The nature of Brahman is pure existence.  Its nature never changes even in creation.  Brahman using its inherent power maya it evolved as Prakriti.  Prakriti has three gunas.  They are sattva, rajas and tamas.  The three gunas were at equilibrium before creation.  By the will of Brahman, the three gunas lost their equilibrium.  From prakriti evolved the five subtle elements and then the five gross elements (pancha bhutas).  They combined to form millions and millions of forms and names.  Before creation each jiva existed in Brahman in the most potential form.  Jiva is the constituent of three principles.  They are the pure Consciousness, the subtle body and the reflection of the pure Consciousness on the subtle body.  Jiva enters in the inert body which is made of pancha bhutas and gives life to the inert body.  Jiva enters in the inert body to experience its karma, which is in the form of subtle impressions.  When its karma in this body is over, it leaves this body and takes another body.  When jiva leaves the body, the body again becomes inert.  Subtle body is mainly made of subtle impressions acquired from the past births.  Even the subtle body was inert until the reflection of Consciousness falls on it.  When the reflection of pure Consciousness falls on the subtle body, the jiva assumes that it is different from the rest and it is independent.  Pure Consciousness is called chaitanya or chit and the reflection of pure Consciousness is called chitabhasa.  All these are the activities of maya which deludes the jiva by its two powers called the avarana shakti (hiding power) and the vikshepa shakti (projecting power).  By the avarana shakti maya hides the real nature of the jiva, which is pure Consciousness.  Due to this the jiva believes that it is powerless, different from the rest, identifies with the body and mind, and experiences happiness and misery.  Maya with its vikshepa shakti projects a false universe, full of imagination and ideas, which later becomes the cause for bondage.  Thus by the power of maya the non-dual Brahman appears as different jivas.  This is ishwara srishti.  Ishwara srishti gives only peace and happiness to all.  Without ishwara srishti the jivas cannot exhaust their karmas.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Jiva srishti is the creation of the mind based on raga (love) and dvesha (hate).  Jiva srishti is also said as manasa prapanjam or manasa srishti.  The main reason for jiva srishti is imagination (sankalpa).  Our karma, knowledge and imagination are the basis for our attitude in life.  The imagination and judgment we impose on the existing ishwara srishti is called jiva srishti.  The imaginary world is called the jiva srishti.  It is purely based on the individual&#8217;s mind.  Our likes and dislikes are based on our karma and our knowledge.  A jiva attracts objects, events and situations in this world according to its karma, upasana (devotion), dharma (right values), austerities, sacrifices and knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">In the creators vision all the objects are equal.  However, we create an imaginary and judgmental world of our own, based on our experiences and understanding.  We continue to live in this imaginary world.  Even though there is ishwara srishti, a jiva continues to live in his created world, the jiva srishti.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Difference between ishwara srishti and jiva srishti</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Even though there are millions and millions of objects in this world, a jiva cannot experience all the objects in this world.  Some may be pleasing to him, some objects may not please his senses, some he may ignore, and he is ignorant of many.  This attitude differs from person to person.  Enjoying mentality, opportunity and circumstances are largely based on the karma and individual capacity.  From this, we understand that ishwara srishti is vast, whereas jiva srishti is limited and small.  Ishwara srishti is the modification of maya and jiva srishti is the modification of the mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Experiences differ from person to person.  No two person experiences an object or event in the same manner.  Basically, there are three types of experiences in a jiva.  They are happiness, misery and indifference.  If an object gives happiness to a person, it may cause misery in another person.  The difference is due to the imagination or creation of attachment or aversion towards an object.  For example, if a person who likes mango gets that fruit, it causes happiness in him.  If a person who hates mango gets it, it causes irritation in him.  If a person who has no attachment or detachment gets it, he is indifferent to it; all the time the mango fruit is the same, but the experiences differ from person to person.  A single object creates different experiences in different people.  Sometimes, a single object creates different feelings in a same person in different times.  Therefore, ishwara srishti do not change, but jiva srishti changes from person to person.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">External objects are not known until the mind comes in contact with it.  When you see an object, a thought wave arises from the mind, goes out through the indriyas (eyes) and pervades the object.  That is, from the mind the antakarana vritti arises.  It reaches the object (vishaya).  It takes the form of the object and returns back to the mind as sukshma vritti.  We perceive the thought form (sukshma vritti) and not the object directly and thus we get the knowledge of the object.  If the thought form and the object are exactly the same, then we get the exact knowledge of the object, which is said as samyak jnana.  Sometimes, as soon as a thought wave is formed, the existing impressions of the object in the mind superimpose a judgment on it and distort the correct understanding of the object.  Thus, we see an object through the glass of the mind.  If the object and the thought form are different (due to misunderstanding) then it is said as viparita jnana or branti jnana.  Even though, iswara srishti has equal importance for all the created objects in the world, jiva srishti has different standards for them, because a jiva views the external world through his mind.  This affects the jiva srishti remarkably.  His misunderstanding leads to the attachment or detachment for the object.  If you see an object without superimposing any idea on it, then you are seeing the object directly.  However, only a jnani can view like that.  Therefore, the ishwara srishti is based on maya and jiva srishti is based on raga (love) and dvesha( hatred).  In ishwara srishti there is no place for hatred.  However, in jiva srishti one of the main reasons for its creation is hatred; thus it differs widely from the point of view of love.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Jiva srishti is the cause for bondage</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Anvaya vithireka nyaya says that when reason (karanam) is present, the effect (kariyam) is also present.  When there is no reason there is no effect.  Applying this principle in this context, when jiva srishti is present &#8211; bondage, misery and happiness are present.  When jiva srishti is absent &#8211;   bondage, misery and happiness are absent.  In waking state (jagrad avasta) and dream state (swapna avasta), jiva srishti is present and so bondage, happiness and misery are present.  In deep sleep state (sushupti avasta), there is no jiva srishti and so no bondage, misery and happiness.  If there is no jiva srishti there is no suka (happiness) or dukha (misery).  However, in all the three states ishwara srishti is present.  In the waking state, there is ishwara srishti but we are more aware of the jiva srishti.  In the dream and deep sleep states we are unaware of ishwara srishti.  In dream state, we purely rely on jiva srishti and in deep sleep state we are unaware of both iswara and jiva srishti.  From the above discussion, it is clear that majority of the time we are attached to the jiva srishti and so jiva srishti is the cause for our bondage.  Moreover, we take decisions based on jiva srishti.  For example, a mango is present before all eyes, but the decision to eat it depends on raga or dvesha.  Even though external world (ishwara srishti) is present our interaction with the world is through the mind, which is jiva srishti.  Therefore jiva srishti is the cause for our bondage (samsara).  A jnani understands both ishwara srishti and jiva srishti are mithya and although he lives in the world he is detached to ishwara srishti and jiva srishti.  He views the iswara srishti as it is and by meditation and knowledge he takes control of the jiva srishti.  He just lives to exhaust his karmas.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Only by the presence of ishwara srishti a jiva can create jiva srishti, by which he exhausts his karmas.  In this place, knowledge helps him to exhaust his karmas in a fast pace and without getting much affected by the karmas.  Therefore, till one attains jnana, ishwara srishti is absolutely needed.  Ishwara srishti helps millions and millions of jivas to exhaust their karmas.  To attain liberation one must know to shift the consciousness level from external to internal.  He must also understand the jiva srishti as mitya (illusion).  A jnani also has jiva srishti, but he knows it as illusion and he is well aware of his real nature.  Since jiva srishti do not bother him, he does not experience the modifications of jiva srishti like jealosy, anger, hatred, love etc.  He views the world as Brahman itself.  To detach from jiva srishti, it should be further understood in the right sense.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Division of jiva srishti</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Jiva srishti is further divided as asastriya jiva srishti and sastriya jiva srishti.  To attain liberation, asastriya jiva srishti must be first removed, and then latter sastriya jiva srishti also must be removed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Asastriya jiva srishti</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Asastriya jiva srishti are the web of thoughts that do not incline with the sastras (scriptures).  To attain jnana one must remove the asastriya jiva srishti; else he may attain jnana by shravana and manana, however he will realize Brahman as the object.  Asastriya jiva srishti can be further divided as thivra asastriya jiva srishti and mandha asastriya jiva srishti.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Thivra (violent) asastriya jiva srishti</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Strong desires and passions which awake strong emotions like anger, lust, revenge etc are said as thivra asastriya jiva srishti.  Sometimes, we may feel that we cannot survive without satisfying these desires.  Such strong desires disturb the mind.  These strong desires are called the asastriya thivra jiva srishti.  These strong desires are to be subdued by knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Mandha (dull) asastriya jiva srishti</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">When the desires are in the beginning stage, they form subtle impressions in the mind.  This causes day-dreaming and makes one to think of the desires often.  Desires in the beginning stage are dull and called as mandha asastriya jiva srishti.  These subtle impressions are the main cause for the rebirth and an obstacle for jnana.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Repeated thinking of an object leads to attachment for that object which evolves as a strong desire for that object.  When we cannot get that object it results in anger.  By anger the mind is deluded and the memory becomes weak.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Dhyana of the object &#8211; sangam (attachment) &#8211; kama (desires) &#8211; krodha (anger) &#8211; moham (delusion) &#8211; loss of memory.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">In this way even a dull desire affects the mind.  When mind has a desire, it deludes the intellect (bhuddhi) and it is called moham.  Mind thinks and bhuddhi decides.  In a jiva, most of the time by the accumulation of knowledge, bhuddhi is programmed to take correct decisions.  However, strong desire in the mind, by repeated thinking, draws the intellect to its side preventing it from taking right decisions; thus, the mind and the bhuddhi both slips from the right path.  Therefore, mind must be focused on the goal.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Sastriya jiva srishti</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Sastriya jiva srishti are the impressions inclined with the sastra (scriptures).  It includes our knowledge based on scriptures, divine knowledge, knowledge of rituals, austerities, dharma, dhana, dhyana etc,.  It is gained by shravana, manana and nididhyasana.  These are absolutely needed for a sadhaka to realize his true nature.  Once he attains a very clear knowledge of the scriptures he has to detach from it; else he will be attached to scriptures and scholarly knowledge, which is an obstacle for liberation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">In the beginning stage of vedanta, one feels that he wants to attain Brahman.  He takes effort by reading scriptures and practices sadhana chatustaya.  In the second stage, he realizes that &#8220;Brahman is in me&#8221;.  In the third stage he strives to know &#8220;That Brahman&#8221;, which is in him.  In the fourth stage he realizes that &#8220;I am Brahman&#8221;.  He realizes that he is Brahman himself.  At this stage he becomes silent.  He leaves all the scriptural practices to remain as Brahman himself.  Ishwara srishti or jiva srishti no longer disturb him and he realizes the entire creation as mitya.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The above discussion makes it clear that the external world is not the root for bondage.  His imagination, interpretation and judgment about the external world are the cause for bondage.  No two person or objects are equal in this world.  They differ by the level of Self awareness.  Thus dvaita viveka helps one to know their cause for bondage and helps them to shift to the higher level of Self awareness</p>

<p style="text-align: center">      THE THREEFOLD NATURE OF PRAKRITI</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Brahman is the Reality.  Maya is the illusion power of Brahman and it is dependent on Brahman.  Maya is also said as mulaprakriti or primordial nature or the original principle.  Maya has three constituent gunas.  When the three gunas was in equilibrium in maya, it was in the unmanifested state, which is said in vedanta as avyakta.  When the three gunas was in equilibrium there was no creation.  Slowly by passage of time the three gunas lost equilibrium.  When they lost equilibrium the three gunas became clear or manifested (vyakta) as sattva, rajas and tamas.  This stage where the three gunas manifested is called prakriti.  prakriti underwent various modifications and it became the infinite universe.  All the objects in the universe are the modification of prakriti.  Hence the three gunas are inherent in each and every object of the universe.  The outline shown below explains the evolution of the universe in a nutshell.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Brahman  &#8211;  maya (three gunas in the unmanifested stage)  &#8211;  prakriti (three gunas manifested) &#8211; sukshma pancha bhutas (the five basic elements in the subtle form)  &#8211;  after undergoing panchikarana the subtle elements became sthula pancha bhutas ( the five basic elements in the gross form) &#8211; they combined to form brahmanda ( very crude form of combination of the five gross basic elements, not fit for beings to live)  &#8211;  bhuvanam (existing universe, fit for beings to live)  &#8211;  sarira ( after creating bhuvana the five elements combine to form gross bodies of various creatures).</p>
<p style="text-align: left">We can very well read from the outline description that the three gunas are inherent in every object of the universe.  In fact, life itself is the play of these three gunas.  One has to become a gunaita, who surpass the three gunas, to know the Reality.  To become a gunaita it is imperative to know the qualities of the three gunas, the way they influence a person to worldly life and to get freedom from its influence.  This article is the answer to these basic points.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>THE THREE BASIC GUNAS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Sattva </strong>or sattvic guna is said as the jnana shakti<strong>.  </strong>It gives the power of knowledge.  The nature of sattva is brightness.  It denotes the sharpness of the mind, clear thought, gentleness, kindness and anything which is refined is said to be sattva.  It gives peace, purity, calmness and thus binds us to this world.  The thirst for knowledge binds us to this world and makes us limited.  The readiness to gain more and more knowledge is the characteristics of sattva.  When sattva shines in a person he understands situations correctly and he has right judgment.  When sattva becomes very prominent in a person he becomes a gunaita (surpasses the three gunas).</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Rajas</strong> or rajasic guna is said as the kriya shakti.  It gives the power of action.  Rajas influences one to greediness, high activity, anger, impatience, anxiety, and relentless desires.  Rajas makes one dependent.  Rajas binds one to action.  Rajas influences one to expect result and by this way it gives anxiety, worry and depression.  It makes the mind disturbed by giving expectations.  Over activity, anger and impatience are the characteristic of rajas.  Desire for action and expectation of result binds one to the world.  When the desire is for knowledge it is sattva.  When the desire is for worldly objects and material gains it is rajas.  When rajas rules in a person he is a non-content, shows anger, selfish attitude, praising himself, hurting others by rude words or actions etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Tamas</strong> or tamasic guna is said as the jada shakti.  It makes one inactive and inertia exists in him.  Tamas is said as darkness and tamas always hides the Reality.  It makes one misunderstand the Truth.  Misunderstanding, wrong thinking, inertia, laziness, giving more value for a meager thing (moha), carelessness, excess sleep and ignorance are all the characteristics of tamas.  Ignorance which is the main characteristics of tamas binds one to the world.  It will not allow a person to know the Reality.  Tamas makes one to have strong belief in their misunderstanding.  Tamas makes one a totally confused person giving him misery, worry, irresponsible and careless nature</p>
<p style="text-align: left">A person is a combination of these three gunas; however only one guna will be dominant in a person for the majority of the time and he is said to have that dominant guna.  No one will have a pure sattva or rajas or tamo guna.  It will always be a combination of three gunas with one guna dominating at a time.  If the majority of the time a particular guna dominates then that person is said to have that guna.  The three gunas are absolutely needed for worldy life; else his life will be imperfect.  Without sattva he cannot gain knowledge.  Without rajas he cannot perform any activity and without tamas he cannot rest.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Sattva gives chitta shuddhi (purity of mind) which helps to attain brahma jnana.  Due to its nature of purity, sattva is considered as the highest guna, next comes rajas and tamas respectively.  When a person has rajas or tamo guna he always has a chance to upgrade his guna to the next higher level by constant practice of that higher guna.  When a person has tamas dominant in him he must upgrade it to rajas by performing actions atleast for material gains.  When rajas is dominant in a person he must upgrade it to sattva by performing selfless service (karma yoga).  When a person has sattva dominant in him he must strive to attain knowledge by shravana (reading scriptures with pure devotion), manana (rethinking about it), and nididhyasana (deep contemplation on the facts) so that he can become a gunaita and attain Brahma jnana.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>The influence of the three gunas in our daily life</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The impressions in the subconscious mind of a person determine the guna of the person.  If the majority of the impressions are sattvic, then the nature of the person is sattvic.  If the majority of the impressions are rajasic then the nature of the person is rajasic.  If the majority of the impressions are tamasic then the nature of the person is tamasic.  As said earlier, the nature of the person can be upgraded by personal effort.  However, if sattva dominates in a person, then he is fit to attain jnana; else jnana will not be established in him permanently.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Gunas have a great impact in the attitude of a person towards his life.  Now we can see how our attitude and thoughts are influenced by the gunas and how a single concept has a threefold nature based on gunas.  These concepts are given in Baghavad gita and it helps a person to judge his own nature and upgrade his guna to the next higher level.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Threefold nature of Faith (shraddha)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Faith is the main factor which moves life.  A person&#8217;s life depends on his faith in his attained knowledge.  If the attained knowledge is good then he will excel in his life; else the opposite happens.  In fact, a man is his faith.  Faith transforms words to knowledge; else words will be only a sound without any purpose.  Faith transforms words to jnana vritti (thoughts).  Hence, knowledge and faith always go together.  All the thoughts that arise from the mind cannot be knowledge.  Thoughts must have some proof before it becomes knowledge; either it must be proven by sastra (scriptures) or by our experience through the five senses.  Faith is an attitude and we can feel its expression in our daily life.  For example, we can see its expression even in the way we worship God.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Sattvic faith</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Sattvic faith leads to salvation and peace of mind.  Faith in dharma elevates us to a higher level.  Sastra says, any energy is divine and it is said as devata.  We worship the multiple expressions of the undivided universal power by different names and forms.  A people who worships God with this concept in mind and by subtle ways like japa, meditation, chanting, silent pooja, offering sattvic food to God and the people who have faith in the higher concepts of life are said to have sattvic faith.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Rajasic faith</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Faith in the very vibrant way of life with many activities and aggressiveness is said to be rajasic.  Faith in the worship of the yakshas, rakshasas and the devatas with rajasic power  by a very vibrant way of poojas like tantric poojas to destroy enemies, poojas which hurt their own bodies and very aggressive way of doing tapas like standing in the middle of the fire etc are said to be rajasic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Tamasic faith</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Faith in the ideal way of life, faith in enjoying the tamasic pleasure like eating and sleeping without performing physical work are said to be tamasic.  Faith in the worship of the disembodied spirits and ghosts by giving them tamasic food like toddy, cigars, meat and pacifying them to get the things done are said to be tamasic.  Tamas will lead one to darkness.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Threefold nature of food (annam)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Chandogya upanishad says that the gross part of the food we intake goes out as waste.  The subtle part becomes blood, flesh and bone.  The subtlest part of the food we intake influence the mind.  Therefore to a large extend the food we intake influence our body and mind.  The quantity of the food we intake is also important.  Half of the stomach should be filled with gross food, quarter should be filled with water and the rest to be left free for the circulation of air, so that it is easy to digest and supply the food to the respective organs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Sattvic food</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The food that are pleasing to the mind, while eating they must give pleasure, food that is not too hot or too hard, easy to digest, food that is not dry, that have pleasing smell and subtle in appearance, food which increase life, gives strength for the body and mind, pure and savory are said to be sattvic.  For example milk, butter, fresh ripe fruits, almonds, green dal, barley, banana etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Rajasic food</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The food that are bitter, sour, saline, excessively hot, pungent, dry and burning, food which gives pain and grief after consumption, which causes diseases by non-digestion or in any other way are said to be rajasic.  Example: red chilies, mustard, garlic, cloves, pungent pickles, brinjal, meat, fish, eggs, onions, coffee, betel leaves, tobacco etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Tamasic food  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Food that are stale, tasteless, putrid, rotten, impure are tamasic food.  Example: all stale and putrid food, food which is kept overnight, leftover food in the plate, liquor, fermented toddy, ganja, opium, cocain etc are tamasic food.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Threefold nature of sacrifice (yagna)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Sacrifice is a way of worship.  The type of energy we worship and the way we worship that energy are very important.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Sattvic sacrifice</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Sacrifices done with all sattvic rites, faith and devotion, following scriptural practices without any desire for worldly material gains are said to be sattvic.  Sattvic sacrifices purify the mind to attain self-knowledge.  It gives maturity to accept the result of our action.  An action done without any expectation of reward and done as an offering to God is said to be sattvic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Rajasic sacrifice</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Sacrifices done for seeking a reward are said to be rajasic.  Sacrifices in the karma kanda of the vedas are done with the target of a worldly gain like begetting a child, wealth, name and fame, position, attaining heaven etc.  The performer of rajasic sacrifice seeks for self importance.  He wants to exhibit his glory to the world.  He has no aspiration to attain self knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Tamasic sacrifice</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The sacrifices which are contrary to the ordinances of the scriptures, sacrifices devoid of any charity or mantras, without faith and devotion performed in a careless way are said to be tamasic.  Such sacrifices do not get any merit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Threefold nature of austerity (tapas)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Austerity (tapas) brings the body, mind and senses under control and this helps one to evolve better.  Tapas can be done in three ways.  They are vak tapas (control of speech), kayika tapas (control of actions) and manasa tapas (control of the mind).</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Austerity done with the body</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Any selfless action done with right attitude is said as tapas done with the body.  Actions done with straight forwardness in the thought, words and action, celibacy, non-injury to others, cleanliness, worship of God are the austerity done with the body.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Austerity done by speech</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Words are used to convey our thoughts and ideas to others.  It must be used in the most appropriate way else our ideas will not be conveyed in a correct manner.  Maximum sins are committed by a person by his inappropriate selection of words.  Speech must be limited, useful, should not cause mental injury to others, must have clarity, and must be truthful.  One must speak in the most pleasant manner.  Arrogance in speech and ordering others by words are the most uncultured way of conveying our thoughts to others.  One should speak in the manner which is pleasing and good for others.  Even mistakes need be corrected using proper words and in a matured manner.  One must not often argue while speaking to others because argument is imposing our views on others.  It disturbs the understanding power in others.  By this, people will try to avoid a person who argues often.  One must think before speaking else they will lose respect.  Chanting veda mantras help to control the speech.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Austerity of the mind</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Feeling of rejection disturbs a person in the most aggressive way.  Therefore, practicing calmness of mind in all situations is a great austerity.  Forgiveness, soft heartedness, treating others with respect and dignity, not insulting others by self talk or by thoughts are considered to be austerity of the mind.  One must use the mind to attain the highest.  Austerity in totality means austerity by body, speech and mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Sattvic austerity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Austerity done with complete faith in God, with full concentration, desiring no material or worldly rewards and done without disturbing ourselves or others are said to be sattvic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Rajasic austerity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Austerity practiced with the object of gaining good reception, expectation of honour and worship from others, done with hypocrisy are said to be rajasic.  They cannot perform such austerity for a long time.  They will leave it midway.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Tamasic austerity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Austerity practiced out of foolish notion with self-torture, for the purpose of destroying another person, austerity done without any scriptural knowledge, done without viveka are said to be tamasic.  Such austerities will not give any knowledge of the self and it will destroy the person.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Threefold nature of charity (dhanam)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Charity removes the selfish attitude in a person.  It gives the mentality of sharing.  Some people may not have sharing or giving attitude, which means giving good new things to others.  Therefore, such people must practice charity initially by giving atleast the used things to others.  Initially there may be expectation in giving, like doing charity for name and fame.  At this stage, one must continue charity atleast for name and fame.  Gradually these expectations will fade of and at one stage they will have the mentality to do right charity without any expectation.  Selfless charity gives chitta shuddi.  There are three types of charity based on the attitude of the giver.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Sattvic charity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Charity done without any expectation, done as a duty, given to the worthy person at the right time and place are said to be sattvic.  The mentality of sharing good new things with others, and treating the receiver with respect and dignity are said to be sattvic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Rajasic charity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Charity done with some expectation like reaping its results in the future, with the expectation of name and fame, expectation of public praise  or some reward in the future are said to be rajasic.  A person doing charity with the expectation of removal of sins by giving it to sanyasis or brahmana or doing it as a part of the ritual or grieves later about the charity are considered as rajasic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Tamasic charity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Charity given at a wrong place and wrong time, to unworthy persons, without respect or with insult are said to be tamasic.  If charity is given to unworthy people then it will make them lazy and the charity will go as waste.  Unworthy people demand gifts from others  and they have a rude behaviour and selfish motive.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Threefold nature of renunciation (vairagya)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Renunciation is considered as a great step towards the Truth and renunciation is threefold.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Sattvic renunciation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Renunciation done with viveka and vairagya, done with the knowledge of the temporary status of the material world, renunciation done with maturity and not in a haphazard way are considered as sattvic.  One should not repent later about the renunciation.  Renouncing any type of pleasure by knowing its temporary nature, by knowing its defects and doing karma yoga are considered as sattvic renunciation.  Sattvic renunciation gives chitta shuddhi.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Rajasic renunciation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Renunciation done due to fear, seen as a scapegoat from difficulty and responsibility, renouncing to receive name and fame, renouncing due to compulsion, or expectation of some reward or position are considered to be rajasic.  Many people take renunciation without knowing the meaning of renunciation in the right context.  Many people consider renunciation as a relief from responsibilities and they think they can enjoy life after taking sanyasa.  It is an absurd idea and it will not give chitta shuddi and make them land in many unexpected problems.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Tamasic renunciation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Renouncing due to laziness to discharge duties, without any real interest, due to ignorance and confusion or just acting like a renounced person is considered as tamasic.  Such sanyasis do not get any benefit from their renunciation life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Threefold nature of knowledge (jnana)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Knowledge is the base for our beliefs and actions.  Knowledge leads one to puniya (virtue) and lack of knowledge or wrong knowledge leads one to papa (sin).  Therefore attaining knowledge is very important in life and Knowledge is threefold.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Sattvic jnana</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Knowledge that tells about the unity in all objects is considered as pure and sattvic.  By this knowledge the perceiver sees the divine Atma, the essence of life in the seemingly diverse universe.  The perceiver sees the one Conscious principle rooted in the diverse objects and by this knowledge he understands that the Conscious principle cannot be destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Rajasic jhana</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The knowledge which sees each entity as separate and distinct, at the same time accepts that each entity has Atma as their core and it is eternal are said to be rajasic jhana.  The idea of separateness is rajasic jhana.  Knowledge which sees multiplicity in created objects and differentiates them as being small or big, according to their attributes are due to rajasic nature.  Rajasic knowledge sees diversity everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Tamasic knowledge</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Tamasic knowledge sees each and every object as a combination of atoms.  They assume the whole body as Atma and thus there are many Atmas.  They consider God as a piece of stone and exist only in the designated place like temples.  It tells that when body perishes the Atma also perishes with it.  Tamasic jhana makes one very limited in their views and ideas and is not all comprehensive.  Tamasic knowledge does not have the power of discrimination.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Threefold nature of action (karma)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The action (karma) we do largely depends on our knowledge and beliefs.  Our thoughts and actions are based on our knowledge and beliefs.  The actions we do are threefold.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Sattvic action</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">An action which is performed as a duty, which is free from attachment, which is done without love or hatred, and done without desire for any reward are said to be sattvic action.  Such type of karma is called pure karma.  He performs action as an offering to God and he does action in accordance with the dictates of the scriptures.  Sattvic karma is otherwise known as karma yoga.  They are actions done without any personal ego.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Rajasic action</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Actions done with an attitude of expecting reward, appreciation and laurels are said to be rajasic.  Actions done with egoism and for receiving recognition from public are said to be rajasic.  Actions done with arrogance, without enjoying the work and over activity are said to be rajasic in nature.  A workaholic is said to be rajasic and he destroys his health and his peace of mind by his work.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Tamasic action</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Actions done in delusion without any regard for the consequences, loss or injury to others and actions done more than one&#8217;s own ability are said to be tamasic.  Actions done with wrong understanding, causing difficulty to others, doing uninterested actions, doing actions which cause mental and body pain are said to be tamasic.  Actions done without any discrimination between the good and bad are said to be tamasic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Threefold nature of the doer of the action (karta)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">A person always has a choice to perform an action; however he does not have the choice while accepting the consequences of the action.  Sattvic actions always give sattvic result.  Rajasic actions give rajasic consequences and tamasic action gives tamasic consequences respectively.  Based on the actions done, doer of the action (karta) are threefold.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Sattvic karta</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Karma yogi is said as a saatvic karta.  He performs action without any attachment, non-egoism, does action with firmness and enthusiasm.  He is unaffected by success or failure.  He attains chitta shuddhi (purity of mind) by his actions.  Sattvik karta is always on the spiritual path.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Rajasic karta</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Rajasic karta is a passionate person, desiring rewards for his action.  A person who does his action in greediness, with cruelty and impurity in mind is said to be rajasic.  He is easily influenced by joy and sorrow.  He will not have a sharing mentality and is unconcerned about the difficulty of others.  He is unconcerned about the chitta shuddhi or the higher aspect of life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Tamasic karta</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">A person whose intensions are not straight forward, who does actions due to instinct and without proper understanding, performing actions contradicting to sastras is said as tamasic karta.  A person who disrespects sastras, Guru and elders, hides his capacity to escape from duty, does actions to spoil the future of others, always sorrowful without enthusiasm, very slow in performing an action, unsteady in his action, lazy, vulgar, malicious and cheating others is said to be a tamasic karta.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Threefold nature of the intellect (bhuddhi)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Bhuddhi is the intellectual capacity to understand the world.  Bhuddhi understands and takes decisions based on the attained knowledge.  Right knowledge gives power for the bhuddhi to discriminate between the Atma and the anatma.  Wrong understanding is the base for all the sins and miseries in the world.  Our thoughts and actions largely influence the bhuddhi.  The nature of the bhuddhi (intellect) is threefold.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Sattvic intellect</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Sattvic intellect gives sattvic jnana which leads to liberation.  Sattvic intellect understands the intention correctly.  It understands matter in the right sense.  Intellect which has discrimination power, fearless nature, and an attitude for liberation is said to be sattvic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Rajasic intellect</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Intellect which cannot discriminate between dharma and adharma, which pretends as knowing everything, and which always doubts is said to be rajasic intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Tamasic intellect</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Intellect which wrongly interprets dharma as adharma and vice versa, which sees all things as perverted, complete wrong understanding of everything is said to be tamasic intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Threefold nature of the firmness of the mind (dhrudatha)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">When we move forward towards a goal there will be many obstacles on the way.  In spite of these obstacles, the mind which holds on to the goal with confidence is said as the firmness of the mind.  Some people by seeing the obstacles their mind wavers, diverts from the goal, the obstacles weakens their mind, weakens the enthusiasm by making them wait and so on.  The mind which holds on to the goal without wavering is said as a firm mind.  The firmness of the mind is threefold.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Sattvic firmness</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Firmness of the mind in dharmic matters is said as sattvic firmness.  Yoga controls the mind, the life force (prana), and the senses from being affected by the external influences so that the firmness of the mind is not affected.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Rajasic firmness</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Firmness in adharmic and selfish matters, firmness in pleasure seeking experiences, attachment and desire for recognition and reward are said to be rajasic firmness.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Tamasic firmness</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Firmness in sleep, not taking enough action to dispel fear, grief, despair, firmness in cheating others are said to be tamasic firmness.  Firmness in wrong understanding inspite of explanation is also said as tamasic firmness.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Threefold nature of pleasure (sukam)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Pleasures we experience in life are due to the virtue of our past actions and our practice of dharma.  The nature of the pleasure we experience are threefold.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Sattvic pleasure </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">That which gives much difficulty and pain in the beginning and by passage of time gives pleasure and happiness are said to be sattvic.  For example practicing yoga, japa, certain austerities, practicing any form of art are difficult in the beginning and by passage of time it gives pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Rajasic pleasure </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">That which gives pleasure and happiness in the beginning and by passage of time gives pain and grief are said to be rajasic.  Rajasic pleasure arises from the contact of the sense organs with the objects.  Involving in adharmic sense pleasure activities are said to be rajasic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Tamasic pleasure</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">That which gives pain and grief in the beginning as well as by the passage of time are said to be tamasic pleasure.  Pleasure in evil habits like eating worthless things namely opium, ganja, drinking liquor, pleasure arising from excessive sleep, indolence etc are said to be tamasic.  All these pleasures make the mind delusive.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">All the matters and concepts in this world are threefold in nature because the entire universe is the expansion of prakriti, which has three gunas namely sattva, rajas and tamas.  Only Atma is free from the clutches of the three gunas.</p>

<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/articles/sanyasa-its-meaning-and-necessity/">SANYASA &#8211; ITS MEANING AND NECESSITY</a></h2>
<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">Apr 12, 2017</span> | <a href="/category/articles/" rel="category tag">Articles</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">SANYASA &#8211; ITS MEANING AND NECESSITY</p>
<p>Sanyasa is accepted by a spiritual person to devote the entire lifetime for the study, spiritual practice and realization of the Truth.  Sanyasa can be accepted at any stage in a person&#8217;s life.  It can be accepted at a very early age during the student life (brahmacharya ashrama), it can be accepted during the grahastasrama (family life) or in the vanaprastha asrama (retired life).  Sanyasa accepted at any stage has its own importance.</p>
<p>Sanyasa is a lifestyle where there is no binding relationship.  It is a unique mental state where one feels that no one is dependent on him and he is also not dependent on any one.  A sanyasi is not expected to perform the duties of the other ashramas like grahasthasrama and vanaprastha ashrama.  They have their own set of discipline and rules for their life style.  For example, begging is not allowed in any other asrama, but it is allowed for the sanyasa ashrama.  Sanyasa ashrama involves a lot of travel and they spend most of the time practicing Brahmavidya.  They eat only to stay alive.  Therefore, when they approach, people in the worldly life help a sanyasi save his life by giving them quality food.</p>
<p>Sanyasa ashrama needs the three basic qualifications.  They are viveka (Knowledge), vairagya (discrimination between the permanent and temporary) and mumukshutva (anxiety to know the Truth).  It is the mental attitude and qualification which makes a sanyasi more than his appearance.  The rules observed in the ashram help one to improve these attitudes and lift them to the next higher stage.  There are two types of sanyasa namely vividesha sanyasa and vidvat sanyasa.</p>
<p>Vividesha sanyasa is said as the first stage of sanyasa.  It involves mostly student life.  Ninety percent of sanyasis are vividesha sanyasis.  When one has viveka, vairagya and mumukshutva one can accept sanyasa regardless of age.  Vividesha sanyasis are expected to perform selfless action.  It helps them to have chitta shuddhi (purity of mind) and chitta ekagrata (one pointedness of the mind).  They manage scriptural study, spiritual practice and along with it they perform selfless action.  They can be said as sadhakas (practitioners of jnana).  Some students spent their entire life time as vividesha sanyasi.  They perform karma yoga to the maximum extent.  The gurus in the ashramas teach them scriptures and help them do spiritual practices.</p>
<p>Vidvat sanyasa is an advanced stage in sanyasa.  Here the students are mostly sadhakas with scriptural knowledge.  They might have attained this knowledge in their family life or retired life by approaching the right guru, reading and understanding the scriptures.  They have done shravana and manana in the earlier stages.  However, they do not have the right atmosphere or time to practice nididhyasana.  They find difficult to establish in Self knowledge due to their viparita bhavana (existing impressions).  Hence they accept sanyasa, stay in an ashrama, and practice the attained knowledge.  They are in their advanced stage.  A jnani who takes sanyasa is called vidvat sanyasi.</p>
<p>Sanyasa is only a choice.  If a person has the three basic qualifications, he can continue in the family life or retired life and attain liberation.  They must be capable of balancing the family life, their studies and practices.  Practice of dharma (right conduct) helps one to study and understand scriptures.  However, when one indulges in worldly activities his mind gets distracted.  Most of his time is spent to maintain and protect himself or to protect his belongings and loved ones.  Therefore, scriptures say that sanyasa is not compulsory but an easy way to attain liberation.</p>
<p>Brahma vidya is the ultimate knowledge.  It is not a religious study.  It is the knowledge about the Self.  Any person who has an intense desire to know the Truth is qualified to know it; he need not compulsorily be a sanyasi.  Many people are hesitant to know the Truth because they fear of being labeled as a sanyasi by the society and family, and will be deprived of family and worldly life.  It is a ridiculous belief which is prevalent in the society and it should be overcome with right understanding.  One should not be pushed in to the sanyasa lifestyle; if so, it does more harm than any good to the person who accept sanyasa and he takes advantage with his status and harm the society.  In modern days, sanyasa is considered as a privilege, or a status or a convenience or accepted without any other option.  If the attitude behind accepting sanyasa is not pure Brahma vidya, then it will shatter that person in multiple ways.</p>
<p>Sanyasa has a deep meaning in spirituality and it is the highest in spiritual order.  It is a life style with discipline and renouncing mental attitude.  In fact, the mental attitude is more important than the mere life style.  If sanyasa is accepted without right understanding, taken in a hurry, or if it is seen as a scapegoat for any problem in life, then it does more harm to the person who has accepted sanyasa and he is harmful for the society as well; and hence scriptures give more importance for the mental attitude to accept sanyasa.  Sanyasa is a renouncing attitude which comes to a spiritual person who finds the material life less important than his goal, to understand the Truth.  However, scriptures say that sanyasa is not compulsory to know the Truth.  It is a life style accepted by people who have the right mental attitude and necessity.</p>
<p>Sadhana (practice) is very important to know the Truth.  Only practice gives liberation and not the lifestyle.  Hence to practice in a disciplined way a person accepts sanyasa.  Every sanyasa ashrama has very strict set of rules which are to be followed by their inmates.  Ashramas expect the sanyasis to maintain internal (mind) and external (body and surroundings) purity.  They are ordained to perform nitya karmas (daily duties) like maintaining their own cleanliness, helping in ashrama duties, pooja etc.  They are prohibited from involving in kamya karmas (actions done to quench their desires), nishida karmas (prohibited duties like cheating, drinking alcohol etc) and prayachitta karma (karmas done to get positive results, they are expected to accept life as it is).  A sanyasi is barred from any action that binds him to the worldly life.  Even after entering the sanyasa lifestyle if a sanyasi indulges in material life, then in the first place what is the need for him to accept this life style?  If a person finds it difficult to live as a sanyasi he can very well stay in the worldly life and practice vairagya till he attains it.  Scriptures do not compel one to accept sanyasa.  That is why it is imperative to stress the need of the three basic qualifications viveka, vairagya and mumukshutva.  Many people accept sanyasa in a hurry.  They are ignorant about the importance and necessity of the sanyasa life style.  When sanyasa is accepted without maturity it is repented later.  A sanyasi without viveka, vairagya, or mumukshutva does not do any good for himself or for the society.  An immature sanyasi is a blot to the society.  In modern times it is common to see many such immature sanyasis.  They stay in sanyasa ashrma and involve in many binding actions which harms the society.  They consider this highly respectable order as a privilege.  An immature mind easily slips to tamas (inertia).  One can very well live in the middle of the society and have family life and uplift the society by their knowledge even without accepting sanyasa.  If sanyasa is accepted then its strict rules and lifestyle must be accepted.  If one has the right mental attitude then it is good to accept sanyasa, else one can remain in worldly life and train the mind for goodness by scriptural studies and spiritual practices.  One can understand the importance of the Atma and the illusionary nature of the world by reading and understanding the scriptures.  A balanced spiritual and worldly life helps a person to find internal and external peace.  Understanding life is more important than accepting a particular lifestyle. </p>

<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/articles/emotional-insecurity-can-lead-to-violent-behaviour/">EMOTIONAL INSECURITY CAN LEAD TO VIOLENT BEHAVIOUR</a></h2>
<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">Mar 24, 2017</span> | <a href="/category/articles/" rel="category tag">Articles</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">EMOTIONAL INSECURITY CAN LEAD TO VIOLENT BEHAVIOUR</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Emotional insecurity &#8211; this phrase may not mean much to our grandparents or parents.  The need to highlight this concept did not arise in their period of time.  They are all emotionally secured people knowing to handle life situations excellently; else, we would not be in this comfortable position today.  They completely absorbed the rich and profound Indian culture and tradition (which the world stand in awe of), which made them emotionally secure in all circumstances.  Unfortunately, of recent times there is a cultural change going on in India and some of them affect various level of the society in a negative way.  The reasons for this change may be decline in the spiritual tendency among people, cross-culture, invasion of the electronic and digital media, and a few lapse in our education system.  As a result of these, emotional insecurities like loneliness, possessiveness, jealously, fear, dictatorship, hatred and anger etc., haunt most of the people.  This is evident from the nature of the recent crimes and violence in India.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">There is no guarantee that the present education system can give emotional security because it is sad to see highly educated people emotionally weak and they disturb the entire atmosphere.  Present education system is merely a skill to earn a comfortable or luxurious living.  It facilitates to attain status.  It doesn&#8217;t impart any knowledge to handle real life situations. It is evident from the trauma the young students&#8217; experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Financial security also cannot guarantee emotional security because we witness fear, loneliness, anger, hatred and various complexes in financially secured people as well.  Definitely, we need money and education for a comfortable life.  However, money and education alone cannot give complete life.  What we have earned will lose its value if we do not enhance it with moral and cultural values.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">In spite of educational and financial security there is decline in moral values.  If the mind of the educated and financially sound is not matured and calm then it does more harm to other people.  Even a slight emotional disturbance will have a negative impact in their attitude towards life.  They quench their anger, frustration, hatred and ego either on people who are dear to them or on the innocent unrelated people.  The main reason for such behaviour is the lack of knowledge about the importance of life, lack of knowledge about themselves, lack of knowledge about God and his creation.  They mix and match all these to suit their ego.  Due to their high handed behavior from infants to old people, from family members to innocent public, all are a victim of their behaviour.  It includes abuses in families, cheating, ragging in colleges, cruelty to animals, physical and mental abuse, harassment, terrorism and many, many more.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Most of the violence and crimes are committed by the youth.  Where is the mistake happening &#8211; is it in the upbringing, is it in the society which we all make, or is it in the influence of the friends and media.  I believe they all have an equal responsibility in molding a person.  A deep hurt, insult or a wrong move from any one of them can emotionally shatter a person and lead them towards perverse mental attitude.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">One of the solutions to this problem is spirituality.  Spirituality can emotionally balance a person to a large extend.  People assume Spirituality as mere superstition or a religion based karmas.  No, spirituality is more than all these.  It is not a gimmick.  It is the understanding of life itself.  It is the ultimate knowledge about our existence.  It enhances our positive moral values.  Spirituality helps us to lead life with absolute dignity.  In spite of our rich spiritual tradition, spirituality has not gone to the grass root level.  People show hesitancy towards spirituality because of the mushrooming of the wrong spiritual gurus.  Still, there are well trained traditional gurus who impart quality knowledge.  Reading and understanding scriptures will also help us have an emotionally secure mind.  It is better to transform ourselves before the law transforms us.</p>

<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/my-views/disciplining/">DISCIPLINING</a></h2>
<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">May 30, 2015</span> | <a href="/category/my-views/" rel="category tag">My Views</a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify">                                                                                Disciplining</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">Disciplining a young mind is very tough because young minds are very sensitive and at the same time very immature. While disciplining, a single wrong move will affect the future of the child drastically. Since the young children do not know to express their feelings properly, their inability is taken as an advantage by the elders both in the family and in the society. When a person approaches the child with maturity and love then it is very easy to handle them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the first place, the person disciplining the child must be an emotionally stable person; else their agitated emotions will affect the child in the wrong way. The next important thing is love for children is not only to confine the child in the high class coaching centers called schools and continuously taming them for higher grades. Today&#8217;s sophisticated education can only help a person earn millions and lead a luxurious life style; it is a question whether the education they attain can make them morally stable with humility and discipline. Love and care for the child includes giving the child the right education, to see whether they are guided by the right people, to see whether they take the right food, checking their behaviour and nature and whether they mingle with the right people. It is important to see whether they understand life in the correct sense. When a person cannot understand life, he cannot be a disciplined person. You can make a child to behave forcibly according to the social norms. However, this is not morality. This can make a person respectable in the society. A respectable person when he gets the right opportunity, due to his latent impressions, tries to behave in an unpleasant way according to favourable circumstances. At the same time, a morally stable person&#8217;s behaviour is always decent and stable under all circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Disciplining should be done with love. Discipline is not suppression of emotions. If you suppress the emotions, it will pop up in a better opportunity. For most of us, disciplining is suppression, conformity and imitation of the habits of the elders. When we follow the same groove set by the elders, we do not live life with understanding. When you suppress a person there is constant battle inside that person. When you deny the emotions with sensitivity, it becomes an immense problem. Suppressed mind unable to handle pressure escape into some other problem or become neurotic. A mind which is unable to tackle a problem, as you see in this world, becomes insensitive, fearful, self-centered and brutal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In my view, a child must be taught the consequences of a wrong action. A child should not be condemned or punished out rightly. A child must be given opportunity to learn from his mistakes. While disciplining a child, he must be given respect and treated as an equal. Nowadays the behaviour of the elders while disciplining the child is more immature than the children.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Disciplining is a common act, but it involves maturity and sensitivity; else disciplining itself will become a root cause for many sick minded people in the society.</p>
