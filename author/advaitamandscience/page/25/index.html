<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">Aug 16, 2013</span> | <a href="/category/articles/" rel="category tag">Articles</a></p>
<h4 align="center">VEDANTA IN ANCIENT AND MODERN TIMES</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Vedanta is being practiced for more than five thousand years in India.  Vedanta is full of profound philosophical revelation by ancient Rishis.  Without their revelations, mankind would have been groping in the dark about the relationship between man, universe and the Supreme consciousness.  The end part of the Vedas is called Vedanta.  Vedas are divided in to four as Rik Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda and Atharva Veda.  Rik Veda has 10552 mantras(verses), Yajur Veda has more than 2000 mantras, Sama Veda has nearly 2000 mantras and Atharva Veda has 6000 mantras respectively.  In the ancient times there was no script; Vedanta was taught by oral rendition.  Only in the later period, these precious verses were scripted in palm leaves.  A good part of the Vedas was destroyed by many rulers who invaded India.  Natural erosion and destruction also destroyed many precious scriptures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the ancient times, a student of Vedanta had to be proficient with the Veda mantras before studying Vedanta.  A student would take approximately twelve years to complete Vedic education.  Only then he was qualified to study Vedanta.  Vedanta is mainly based on Upanishads.  Upanishads are many and only 108 Upanishads are available at present, and among them Adi Shankara wrote commentary for only ten Upanishads.  Upanishad verses are deep philosophical revelations by various Rishis.  Only a matured intelligent mind can grasp the in depth meaning of the Upanishad verses.  When a student practices Veda mantras and Vedic rituals, the mind becomes more involved and this helps the mind to evolve more.  Upanishad teachers were also very rare.  A teacher accepted a student, only after knowing about his capacity and maturity to grasp the subtle concepts of the Upanishads.  In the ancient times, Sanskrit language was compulsorily learnt before learning Vedas, because only then a student would be able to understand the <i>Rishi Vakya</i> by his own, else he had to depend on the commentaries( like modern times).  The teachers gave them freedom and helped them to analyze and learn by their own.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It was not compulsory that a student of Vedanta should pursue an ascetic life.  They can have a family life and devote time to learn and practice Vedanta.  In the ancient period there were no technological advancement.  People mainly spent their life in spirituality or in agriculture.  In the ancient period people devoted their entire life to practice Vedanta.  People who practiced Vedanta were considered as the cream of the society.   In the epic period, it was compulsory for the young princes to go to a <i>gurukul</i> ( home of the teacher) to learn Vedanta, because they believed that only a stable, matured and learned king can rule their subjects in a perfect way.  Even though Vedanta could be learnt by any one regardless of the caste, creed, gender or race, people mainly from the <i>brahmin</i> community learnt Vedanta.  In fact, the truth is, an individual who has the knowledge of <i>Brahman</i> is called a Brahmin.  In the later period, the generations of these <i>Brahmins</i> assumed this name, regardless of their knowledge about <i>Brahman</i>.  Even woman were not barred from learning Vedanta.  People, who led family life, after completing their family responsibilities, retired to the forest to learn Vedanta.  This included even ruling Monarchs.  This period of life is called <i>Vanapratha</i>.  Vedanta should not be denied to anyone, because it is the education about the Self.  Every individual has the right to learn Vedanta, which is also known as <i>Brahma Vidya</i>, but at the same time, these precious and glorious teachings should not be wasted on someone who does not take it seriously.  Attaining success in <i>Brahma vidya</i> is an entirely different matter, which is depends on the past karmas, grasping power, facility and atmosphere to practice Vedanta etc.  However, it has to be learnt with humbleness, seriousness and with regards and respect to the Rishis who revealed them, else, we are degrading our own Self.  It is the responsibility of the guru to teach Vedanta to an apt student.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The manner in which the ancient people viewed the world is entirely different from the manner in which a modern man views the scientific world.  The ancient people never disturbed the nature; they respected nature and considered it as a part of them.  Their habits and their serene nature enabled them to live in thick forests.  The pure atmosphere of the forest helped them to evolve more.  In ancient period realizing the Self was not rare.  They recorded their inner revelations as verses and scriptures, which are helpful for the modern world.  When the time advanced, the land space increased and the forest moved inside.  When the technology developed, systems changed drastically.  During the epic period and later, Vedic rituals became prominent than Vedanta.  Many religions evolved from Vedas.  All these together distorted the purity of practicing Vedanta.  This continued for a long time and many changes came to spirituality until Jagad Guru Sri Adi Shankaracharya brought back the system of Vedanta in the form of Advaita Vedanta.  He travelled throughout India by foot and observed that people misunderstood Vedanta and practiced it in the way which is convenient to them.  His works based on Vedanta, helped to understand Vedanta in the correct manner.  He explained the tough verses of the Upanishads in the simplest form with proper metaphors and anecdotes.  To spread Vedanta, he established mutts in four parts of India, in Badarikashrama, Puri, Dwaraka and Shringeri.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">With this, Vedanta became more easily accessible.  With the advantage of the printing technology in the world, in the modern period, the Upanishads and its commentaries are available in the book form.  This enabled Vedanta to spread to a larger circle.  Along with every advantage, there will be a disadvantage.  The disadvantage of the modern Vedanta is, people failed to recognize the importance and the glory of the Upanishads.  To understand the indepth meaning of the Upanishad verses, we have to think exactly like the Rishis, else the profound meaning and the greatness of the verses cannot be enjoyed.  In the modern period, people mainly depend on the commentaries of the Upanishad teachers.  Many do not have the knowledge of Sanskrit.  The Mutts and the Ashramas in various parts of the world help everyone to understand Vedanta by their teachings and publications.  They help to continue the Rishi line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the modern period, Swami Vivekananda shocked the world with <i>Rishi Vakyas</i>, through his extraordinary speeches.  The world woke up to see India only after his bold and meaningful words.  His contribution to spreading Vedanta is unparallel.  He gave speeches in the way that even a layman can understand Vedanta.  In the modern world, there will not be many people who devote their entire life to Vedanta.  Therefore, to suit the modern world, he gave Vedanta in a capsule form, so that anyone can digest the ideas of the Upanishad verses easily.  If Vedanta is not spread, it will not proceed to generations.  Swami Vivekananda gave lectures about the importance of Vedanta in normal life.  He brought Vedanta to the outside world which was still then in the thick forests.  In recent times, Vedanta is offered as a full fledged degree course in many Universities and Vedanta research institutes all over the world.  This paved way for many people who are interested in Vedanta, to do in depth research on the subtle concepts of Vedanta.  Many scholars compare the concepts of Vedanta with other religious concepts.  The latest area in Vedanta is to compare Vedanta with science.  Scientists are trying to understand the subtleness of Vedanta.  Knowledge of the Self can be had from nature, science, art, music etc.  This is an indirect method.  In this method, we go from the effect to the cause and reach the causeless cause, the Supreme truth.  The substratum of all the scientific truths, physical and mental phenomena, and the natural laws is the one Supreme Truth.  Even though his mode of approach to Truth may be different, a real scientist is only a Vedantin.  By studying metaphysics, people accepted the fact that creation is one, but seen from different planes of vision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In modern period, many people learn Vedanta out of curiosity.  Meditation, one of the paths to Self realization, is practiced for relaxation of the mind.  It is very hard to find any serious pursuers in the field of Vedanta.  The goal of Vedanta should be properly understood.  If the goal is not clear, then the path will be a distorted path.  Even a little knowledge about Vedanta will help a person to attain Self realization in a slow pace.  The knowledge of Vedanta is never wasted.  In the modern period, people do not have the mental ability or capability like the Rishis.  Vedanta makes the mind stronger and helps us to face the entanglements in life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Bhagavad Gita, which has many Upanishad ideas has found world wide acceptance in recent times.  Many scholars and spiritually evolved people have written commentaries for Baghavad Gita.  Common man found Baghavad Gita easier to understand than the heavy philosophical facts of the Upanishads.  Another scripture, Srimad Bhagavad has also found worldwide recognition and acceptance because of its simplified way of making people understand the Vedanta revelations through stories and anecdotes.  Vedanta helps an individual to have a stable mind, in spite of crisis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the ancient times, <i>Bhakti</i> was used as a way to attain Self realization.  The margin between <i>Bhakti</i> and Vedanta is very subtle.  The all pervading Supreme consciousness is superimposed on a particular form.  In the modern time, without understanding the truth, a fear factor is created with an idea that God will punish the wrong doers, and people separated the concept of God from the ordinary human being.  They failed to understand that <i>Bhagavan</i> is the inner consciousness and intelligence, which shines brightly when the curtain of ignorance is removed by <i>Bhakti</i>(devotion).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Scriptures lead us to Self realization by knowledge.  It wants us to realize <i>Brahman</i> as our Self through Knowledge.  Vedanta helps us to reveal the Truth by peeling off each layer of ignorance.  The teaching methods used in Vedanta are applicable at all times.  The more we learn Vedanta, the more we find out how ignorant we are.  Vedanta is nothing but the proper understanding of the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Swami Vivekananda says that &#8216; You will be the way, you view yourself.  If you view yourself as the Supreme powerful consciousness, then you are Brahman.  If you view yourself as mind and body, then you are that&#8217;.  Vedanta practiced in the physical presence of a guru will definitely make a difference.  Sometimes, this is lacking in the modern world.  Even though Vedanta is not practiced in the exact way as in the ancient period, the legacy of the Vedanta is still continuing for the benefit of the human race.  The teachers of Vedanta will hold the torch and spread the light of Truth universally, for generations.</p>

<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/my-views/forgiveness/">FORGIVENESS</a></h2>
<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">Aug 9, 2013</span> | <a href="/category/my-views/" rel="category tag">My Views</a></p>
<h4>                                                                                   FORGIVENESS</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Forgiveness is one of the fine natures of a human being.  Spirituality expects a person to always forgive others even in the most adverse situations.  Even in the most trying and challenging situations, spirituality will not allow to take revenge on others, instead advice to forgive others regardless of the harm done by others.  If the psychology behind the act of forgiveness is understood then it will be easy to forgive others, otherwise there will be a grudge in our heart about the harm done to us by others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Forgiveness is forgetting.  It is forgetting the person who has done us harm.  When we hold resentment against someone, it becomes a very strong negative emotional link with that person and we are bound by that link.  We are linked with that person who has done us harm.  The negative bondage becomes stronger when we repeatedly think about the harmful action done to us.  This link does more harm than physically experiencing that harmful action.  When we are linked to any person, the mental vibrations of that person will affect us.  If it is a negative link, then the vibrations will affect us in the negative way.  This negative link will not make us free from the entanglement.  Instead, when we forgive(forget) that person along with the negative action, then the link with that person is mutilated from our side, so that their negative vibrations will not affect us.  Even if the other person sends strong negative vibrations towards us, our strong positive mentality will not receive it.  Our strong mentality will act as a shield towards others negative reactions.  Actually forgiving means, we are making our own mind free from the disturbances of that incident and emerging out from the pain and hurt caused by others.  When we understand a person&#8217;s perspective, we have to detach from that person mentally without blaming anyone, because blaming is another negative link.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Taking revenge is not an appropriate reaction.  In the first place, our mind will be badly affected by such actions.  Secondly, the precious time of our life should not be wasted in thinking harm to others.  It will reduce our time to improve ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In my view, when we have a strong powerful feeling about ourselves like &#8216; I am a powerful being and nothing negative can affect me&#8217;, then our own thoughts will protect us.  In case, when we are physically disturbed, we must take appropriate actions without holding any grudge for that person.  We must be able to shift thoughts before the negative emotions go deep into our mind.  Mental pain is the cruelest than the physical pain.  Instead of getting stagnated in the negative thoughts, shifting thoughts will help a person to come out of the mental hurt and pain.  The mind must always remain in the positive aspects of life else it will become weak.  A weak mind can be easily influenced and affected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If someone else holds resentment towards us, we need not be bothered about it, because it is their problem.  We must stop penetrating in others mind else their negative reactions will affect us badly.  Unnecessary calculations and assumptions will affect our mind and reduces its capacity.  We have no accessibility to control others mind so it is better to control our own mind from being affected by any negative advances.  We must cultivate the habit of forgiveness else depression will affect our life very badly.</p>

<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/my-views/advice-and-decision-making/">ADVICE AND DECISION MAKING</a></h2>
<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">Aug 9, 2013</span> | <a href="/category/my-views/" rel="category tag">My Views</a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify">                                                                      ADVICE AND DECISION MAKING</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: justify"></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">Decision making is an important art.  Each moment is based on our decisions.  If we fail to take an apt decision at the correct moment, then opportunities will elude us.  It is best to take decisions of our own.  Sometimes we may not be able to decide of our own due to dilemma, we may not be well aware of the situations and circumstances, or sometimes we may even feel that someone else is more knowledgeable than us.  Whatever may be the reason, we must approach the correct person for advice else their ignorance and confused state of mind will deter us more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When someone asks us advice, we have to remember that we are directing them to take an important decision.  Having this point in mind we have to advice them in the most sensible and responsible way.  There is nothing wrong when we do not advice anyone, but when we advice someone, it matters a lot.  Some people advice in the way that is profitable to them.  This is cowardice and it has to be avoided.  Our ideas may be favorable to us, but we must see whether it will favor others the same way.  When we advice someone, our ideas are very important for that person, at that point of time to take a decision.  We mostly advice others based on our experience.  Our experience is based on our karmas, our capacity to deal with a situation, our talent, our determination and willpower.  These five factors differ with each and every individual.  We always advice others based on our personality in mind.  These advices may or may not be apt for their way of living.  Before we advice someone, all these factors have to be considered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In my view, we must not compel anyone by the name of advice.  The five factors like karma, capacity, talent, determination and willpower in others will definitely be above or below our own limit.  No other person will have these five factors exactly the same as ours.  If our ideas do not tally with their mentality, then they will be in more confusion and delusion.  To avoid this, we can tell them about the probable solutions and consequences and allow them to take decision of their own.  We must help and support others to take their own decisions.  When we give them an idea, it will be helpful for them to decide of their own.  Our words and ideas must enable others to be aware of their positive qualities and capabilities.  Such words will create a positive vibration and self confidence in others and this will enable them to take their own decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Decision making is very important in one&#8217;s life.  This art must be trained from childhood.  A child must be trained to take decisions independently and aptly according to the situation.  Parents and teachers instead of spoon feeding their own ideas, they must help the child to take decisions independently and aptly.  Even though it is our child, these five factors will definitely differ in the child.  It is our ignorance to force our ideas on them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When someone ignores our advice, there is no need to panic or feel bad about it, because the five crucial factors may have made them to decide in their own way.  At the same time never advice a person who always ignores our advice, because our words and ideas are wasted on something which is always ignored.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Advice is not an easy thing to do.  It is the most responsible and prominent thing because others future is dependent on our ideas.  Our words must not at any time lower the confidence level of others.  Confidence is something which is hard earned by our experience, hard work and success.  A person survives in difficult times with their hope and confidence.  If our words disturb their confidence and hope, then it is same as killing them in the most brutal way.    If our words and ideas help others come out of their entanglements in life, then it is the most virtuous thing a person can experience in his life.</p>

<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">Aug 4, 2013</span> | <a href="/category/articles/" rel="category tag">Articles</a></p>
<h4>                                                                                ANCIENT ANECDOTES</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mind is the center of all the happenings and disturbances in the life.  If the mind and senses are controlled then liberation can be achieved easily.  A person cannot have self realization by Vedic rites, uttering mantras, reading scriptures or by any other means.  Only when a person realizes that his true nature is not different from Brahman, he is a self realized person.  There are many paths which lead a man to self realization.  Meditation is one among them.  The five senses and the mind always becomes an obstacle for all persons to reach the goal of self realization.  Mind uses the five senses to gather information from the external world.  When the five senses are shut, mind becomes totally detached from the external world.  When the mind understands about the senses, the mind will not be deluded and it will have the power to overcome the senses.  Senses represent the different aspects of the mind.  Senses do not exist independent of the mind.  The more the intellect the more it disturbs the mind.  All the individuals have the power to attain self realization, but many do not use it.  Self realization is the state of abiding in intelligence.  According to Vedanta philosophy, when an individual soul merges with Nirguna Brahman( Brahman without attributes), he is beyond thought and mind; when he is Saguna Brahnman ( Brahman with attributes), he has mind and he thinks.  When the mind realizes that it rests in infinity then no obstacle can disturb it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When the senses are directed outwards, worldly pleasure affects the human beings.  Mind which is not dependent on the senses is a stable mind.  Nature is a great classroom from which we can learn many lessons to lead a perfect life.  It was Sage Dattatreya, who explained this concept to the world by himself mentally accepting twenty four gurus from nature.  Sage Dattatreya was a well renowned and an erudite sage of ancient India.  In Srimad Baghavad, he explains about the lessons he derived from the way of life of the twenty four beings from nature that he consider as his <i>Guru</i>.  These lessons helped the Sage to evolve as a perfect person and chisel his life as a blazing spiritual power.  He learnt many lessons to do and not to do from the characteristic traits of the twenty four Gurus.  Sage Dattatreya had a stable unwavering mind which is not common among the worldly people.  When we care too much for the senses, our knowledge will be destroyed, the mind and speech will fritter away.  Sage Dattatreya&#8217;s twenty four gurus are the earth, air, sky, water, fire, sun, moon, pigeon, python, ocean, moth, elephant, honey-bee, honey gatherer, deer, fish, pingala the courtesan, child, osprey, maiden, arrow-smith, spider, snake, wasp.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1. Forbearance is one of the fine quality which is missing in people today.  Forbearance should come with responsibility.  When we lack the quality of forbearance, we are not qualified to occupy a responsible position.  Sometimes others life may overlap or affect our own life.  A man of steady intellect will not waver from his own path.  A person of controlled mind does not get disturbed by the external disturbances.  The sage learnt the lesson of forbearance from the <b>earth</b>, which accepts everything with patience and forbearance.  He also learnt the art of being useful to others from the nature of the tree.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2. A person with steady intellect should not be carried away by the influences of the other people.  He must be detached from the external influences.  Then only he will be able to take decisions in the most <i>dharmic </i>way.  This is the lesson the Sage learnt from <b>air</b>, which remains unaffected by the good and bad odour of things over which it blows.  The air is always pure.  A person has to move amid people of diverse characters, but his mind must be absolutely free from their virtues and short comings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">3. Time brings a lot of change in man and his surroundings.  Just like the sky which is not disturbed by the rain, thunder, storm or even by the explosion of the galaxies, a stable man should not be affected by the incidents in his life.  This lesson the Sage learnt from the <b>sky</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">4. A person of pure intellect exercises a sanctifying influence on others.  Their pure and serene nature helps us to purify ourselves.  When we approach some people we feel comfortable and relaxed.  This is the lesson the Sage learnt from the <b>water,</b> which purifies any kind of impurity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">5. A man of self control is not polluted at any time or under any circumstances.  He remains unpolluted like the all consuming fire which is not polluted by the material it consumes.  This is the lesson the Sage derived from the <b>fire</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">6. The waning and the waxing of the <b>moon</b> taught the Sage that nothing in this world is permanent.  The good and bad times fade away like the digits of the moon.  In spite of the creation and destruction, only Atma remains permanent.  The Atma takes the body, keep it for some time, then sheds it, then again takes a new body and so on.  Everything is a passing phase.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">7. The lesson taught by the <b>sun </b>is that, the sun illumines millions of objects.  Just like that, a person of controlled mind can illumine and show the path for many people.  Many people will be benefited by a single person of pure intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">8. Another wonderful lesson the Sage learnt is from the <b>pigeon</b>.  The Sage learnt about the negative side of the undying affection and attachment.  He explains it with a story.  Once there lived a pigeon which had undying attachment and affection towards its family.  One day the little pigeons were caught by a fowler; by seeing this, unable to bear the pain, the female pigeon fell into the net by itself.  Then seeing the whole family in trouble, the male pigeon also voluntarily fell into the net.  The fowler had a nice catch.  Undying attraction and affection towards the family destroyed the whole family.  This problem exists very commonly in the present time.  Some families unable to bear the pain, loss or failure of a single person in the family, the other members of the family also become a victim to that pain and failure.  Instead of supporting the person in pain, the whole family becomes a victim.  Intense love or attachment to anyone will result in excruciating suffering and pain.  A miserable family man with uncontrolled senses comes to grief together with his belongings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">9. Over enjoyment of the senses will definitely lead a person to misery.  A man of controlled mind and senses will not exert himself too much for food or other enjoyments.  He just eats to live.  He concentrates more on his duty and leaves the results and other benefits to follow him.  He will not go after the benefits rather he takes what he gets.  A Self controlled person is well aware of the fact that rewards are brought by destiny.  This lesson is learned from the <b>python</b> which just takes in what comes its way.  It will not exert much pressure to go and collect its food.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">10. An ocean never gets dried up or overflow by the quantity of the water that comes to it.  It is the nature of the ocean to maintain its water level.  The ocean never overflows or dries up.  Just like that a stable intelligent person will be placid and profound.  A person must be able to maintain his calmness in abundance of joy and in tragedy.  The lesson the Sage learnt from the <b>ocean. </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">11. An intelligent self controlled man will not become a prey for gold, women or any other objects of enjoyment.  The Sage learnt this lesson from the <b>moth</b>.  The moth is unaware of the danger of the fire; it goes to the fire thinking that it is a bright light.  A man of uncontrolled senses fails to discriminate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">12. In the modern world and in the ancient times, women are used as a trap to extract money, position, status, and what more, even to extract a person&#8217;s life.  The Sage learnt this lesson from the <b>elephant </b>which falls in the trap of men, who uses the she-elephant as a trap.  Just for the attachment for the sense of touch, the elephant goes after the she-elephant and finally the she-elephant will escape, but the elephant will live its entire life in captivity and misery.  A wise person will always overcome the attraction towards the opposite gender.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">13. An intelligent self controlled person should take the essence out of all sources, from the scriptures, from the people they meet, from situations they face etc.  This keen observation will definitely make a person wise.  This lesson the Sage learnt from the <b>honeybee</b> which extracts honey from all the flowers they sit on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">14. Everyone needs wealth to survive but when it exceeds a limit, the wealth itself will become a factor for our own destruction.  The Sage learnt this lesson from the <b>honey gatherer</b>.  The honey gatherer destroys the bee hive and drives away the honey bees to extract honey.  The wealth accumulated by a miser without himself enjoying or making charitable gifts is knocked away by someone who knows about it, just as the honey gatherer.  In the modern world, people are killed or disturbed cruelly to snatch their hard earned wealth.  Poet Bhartrihari says that wealth must be either given away in charity or utilized personally, else it will fill the pockets of the robbers!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">15. A wise man should not be a slave to the vulgar music, lest he will thereby get entangled.  This lesson is learnt by the Sage from the <b>deer,</b> which is captured through the hunter&#8217;s imitative cry of the doe.  Music is a very powerful medium which entangles the mind in it.  Divine music calms the mind; vulgar music deludes the mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">16. Behind every sense pleasure there lurks a reaction.  Men perish through the attraction of the palate which causes intense excitement in the mind.  The Sage learnt this lesson from the <b>fish </b>which is caught by its bait.  Taste is a very powerful sense by which a man can be easily overpowered.  When the organ of the taste is controlled, the other senses can be easily controlled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">17. <b>Pingala</b> was a courtesan, an ignorant woman of uncontrolled mind, who seek satisfaction from unworthy men looked upon them as lovers.  She was greedy after money and waited for rich men whom she thought would satisfy her greediness.  Soon she realized that her expectations are in vain and suddenly she felt an unattached feeling towards her body.  She began to feel, that she gave much importance to the body which is filled with impurities, and she wasted the life by neglecting the Atman which is the source of happiness.  From the courtesan&#8217;s life the Sage learnt that &#8220;expectation is the greatest misery, and giving up all expectation is the greatest bliss&#8221;.  In the technological world, expectations cannot be avoided, but it is foolish to depend on expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">18. Honour and dishonour disturbs the mind of all people and only a Sage who has realized the Atma and a child are free from this expectation.  A child is free and least cared about the honour and dishonour.  The child is always immersed in supreme bliss because of this habit.  The Sage learnt this lesson from the <b>child</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">19. When we have something to share and give (wealth and position), the whole world will be around us.  Sometimes others may also disturb us for our possessions.  This lesson the Sage learnt from the <b>osprey</b> which had a piece of meat and attacked by other powerful birds that had no meat.  When the osprey dropped the piece of meat, the other birds were after the meat and left the osprey free.  The world is always after the possessions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">20. If too many people live together, quarrel will be the result.  If we are alone, we will have time and peace of mind to realize the Atma.  This lesson the Sage learnt from a <b>maiden</b> who broke all the bangles she were wearing except one,to avoid the noise made by the bangles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">21. The Sage learnt the power of concentration from the <b>arrow maker</b> who was too busy making his arrows and did not even notice the procession of the king which is passing near his work place.  A person must have the mind controlled within him.  A person of great concentration will not know anything external or internal and is completely absorbed in his work.  Such concentration power will definitely lead to success.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">22. From the <b>spider</b> the Sage learnt the theory of evolution and dissolution.  Just as the spider brings out its web from within itself through the mouth, sports in it for some time and then withdraws it into itself, so does the Supreme Being create, spread and withdraw the universe all by Himself.  The universe is not different from Brahman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">23. If a person rests in a permanent resting place, he will be dependent on his surroundings.  This curbs his independent nature.  He may feel uncomfortable to adjust to new atmosphere and situations.  He should always move out, instead of staying in the same place for a long time.  Even though he may not have his own resting place at different places, he must feel comfortable to stay in the place of others, just like a snake which always stays in the place of other beings.  This lesson the Sage learnt from the <b>snake</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">24. On whatever object a corporeal being may concentrate his whole mind, either through love or through hate or through fear, he attains the form of that very object.  The wasp places the worm in a hole and continuously frightens it by its buzzing sound.  The worm inside thinks and thinks of that wasp till it attains a form partly resembling that of the wasp.  The personality and mentality changes according to the strong impressions in our mind, just like the worm which has strong impressions about the wasp.  This lesson the Sage learned from the <b>wasp</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We have to leave even this body behind, because it is not our own.  Body is only used by the mind to gather experience and learn from its experiences.  In due course the mind evolves to perfection.  The mind evolves more and more and ultimately expands to infinity.  An intelligent person understands about this journey and conducts his life according to the knowledge he has gathered in his lifetime by using this body.  When we are ready to learn, the universe will become a teacher.  In this modern technological world, these twenty four teachers from nature help us to evolve as a perfect person.  These teachers elevate us from our present mental state.  These teachers help us to control our mind.  A soul takes the human form only after many births in various forms(bodies).  A human form is very rare, it must be used in the most profitable way( i.e for self realization), else the greatness and the unique nature of the human form is wasted.</p>

<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">Jul 27, 2013</span> | <a href="/category/my-views/" rel="category tag">My Views</a></p>
<h4>                                                              POWER OF MEDIA ON THE MIND</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mind has incredible power; unfortunately it is the most misused power.  Every mind is unique and has tremendous creative power.  It is the responsibility of each individual to use it in the most proper and earnest way.  Many thoughts rush in the mind at a time.  We must use our inborn intelligence to choose the correct thoughts according to the situation.  This is creativity.  Most of the thoughts have to be ignored because they are unwanted thoughts.  Thoughts have to be very carefully selected because thoughts lead to action and the future depends on the present thoughts and actions.  Thought depends on</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1. The information we provide to the mind</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 2. Past experiences</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">3. Strong beliefs</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We always believe that happiness and sorrows are based on external situations.  When we analyze the mind, we will find out that this belief is wrong.  Emotions and feelings are based on the thoughts, regardless of the external situations.  External situations become stimulant to the mind, but if the mind is stable and strong, external situations have a least impact on the mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Many believe that entertainments like watching TV or movie, browsing, reading novels and books can relieve the mind from tension and sorrows.  It may be true, but the mind goes back to the previous state once the entertainment is over.  The information we take in by the name of entertainment is very important, because information influence the mind to think.  The impact of the media on the mind must be understood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When we watch a media, the media overpowers the mind.  During that period the media suppresses the mind.  The media will not allow the mind to think of its own.  We react to the characters we watch or read in the book.  Mind totally becomes one with the media.  During that suppressed period, the power of the mind to create original thoughts completely stops.  The more we involve with the media the more we like it.  The media becomes the stimulant for the mind to create thoughts.  When we watch TV or other media, the media is thinking for us.  It is because of this reason we like it.  We get so much involved with the media.  The mind will become lazy to think after the entertainment is over.  The mind will become numb; sometimes we even reject food and other duties.  If this continues for a long time, the mind will feel lazy to create original thoughts and we will become more and more dependent on the media.  Especially the young mind of the children will lose its power of creativity and become more lazy and dependent on technology, so that they do not need to do much of their own.  Mind at any cost should not lose the power of original thinking, because thinking and analyzing is a unique quality which distinct man from other beings.  Moreover, the information we provide to the mind gradually changes the thought process and the personality of the person.  When we watch lot of violence stuff, then our personality becomes violent.  When we watch lot of horror, sorrow or disasters, then we will become a fearful and insecured person.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In my view, gathering information   in today&#8217;s scientific world is very important, but we must be matured enough to detach ourself from the media while watching it, so that, the media will not have a direct impact on the mind.  The time for watching the media must be strictly restricted else the mind will lose its power of creativity.  The most affected part of a being by the media is the mind.  In the early morning hours(4 Am to 6 Am), time of <i>Brahma Muhurtha</i>, the receptive power of the mind will be very high.  During that time we have to provide the mind with powerful positive thoughts.  This will definitely have positive change in our personality and life.  Prayer has two powers &#8211; knowledge and strength.  Knowledge creates self confident positive thoughts and strength helps us to face the negative impacts of our past karmas.  We can shrug of the pain and sorrows by prayerful confident mind rather than entertainments.</p>
