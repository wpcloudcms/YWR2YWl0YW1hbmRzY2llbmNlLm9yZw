<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/my-views/self-reliant-and-self-respect/">SELF- RELIANT AND SELF-RESPECT</a></h2>
<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">Mar 9, 2015</span> | <a href="/category/my-views/" rel="category tag">My Views</a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center">SELF- RELIANT AND SELF-RESPECT</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Self- reliant and self- respect have deep relationship and the relationship is not explicit. People who respect the self and disallow others to take advantage of them are the people who become independent in all aspects of life. Total independence means independent physically, mentally and financially. In my view, financial independence is the final decision, prior to that one must be physically and mentally independent to become a perfect self-reliant person.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Many people ignore physical and mental dependence. In fact, many are not aware of this dependence. People demand help from others thinking that it is their right to demand help from others. They forget the fact that by demanding physical help from others they are becoming dependent on others without their own knowledge. This is physical dependence. Likewise, many people are dependent on others ideas. They hesitate to take decisions of their own. In the name of consultation, they depend on others to take their decision. They depend on others advice and they fail to use their thinking capacity and they feel more comfortable with others ideas. This is mental dependence. Least importance is given for independence of thoughts. When we depend on others, the dependent person becomes weak and the helping person becomes powerful. When we become dependent, we lose our power to be self-reliant and gradually it reduces the self-respect. Being independent means it is not to ignore or disrespect others views and ideas. It means to give priority to our views and at the same time considering others views with equal respect. One must know to balance between the two.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In many homes, women are more dependent on others, especially mothers. They are dependent on other family members. They always take a back seat and they even hesitate to give their own views. They hesitate to take care of themselves. They feel that it is selfishness to care of themselves. This is a wrong notion. Only a self respecting mother can teach a child to become self- reliant. Some women allow themselves to be treated like a doormat and they blame others for their condition. It is true that some family situations cannot be avoided; however a large part lies on the ignorance of the concerned person and failing to establish the right as a human being. It is not a sacrifice to ignore ourselves. Instead, it is a sin. When we ignore ourselves, we are ignoring the divine power in us. Sacrifice is something that when we give it to others they will gain by it. When we give our self-respect, we lose it and others will not gain by it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There must be clear priorities in life. We must know our priorities then only life becomes useful. Helping others and getting help from others are common in life and it improves our relationship with others. However, it should not leave us in the dark. If we lose our self-respect we cannot become self-reliant, this leads to frustration and depression, and at one stage we will show displeasure to the same people whom we have helped or from whom we have received help. One must realize the purpose and importance of life. Every individual is born with a definite purpose and a person who realizes this will succeed easily.</p>

<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">Feb 20, 2015</span> | <a href="/category/articles/" rel="category tag">Articles</a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center">               BHAKTI YOGA</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> <em>Bhakti</em> (devotion) is an attitude of the mind and it is expressed in various ways. <em>Bhakti</em> is the pure form of love towards the highest principle, which is called &#8220;<em>Bhagavan</em>&#8221; (God). In fact, it is the love towards the highest principle, which does not have a name or form. Feeling is an important aspect of <em>bhakti</em> and only a peaceful mind can feel <em>bhakti</em>. To induce the feeling of <em>bhakti</em>, the highest principle without a name, form or quality is superimposed with name, form and quality. We superimpose limitations to the Infinite Consciousness with the help of our thoughts, and we call that feeling as <em>bhakti</em>. Pure Love is unconditional and unexpecting. If we expect something in return for our love towards <em>Bhagavan</em>, then it is not the pure <em>bhakti</em>. When we give love, we receive love in return. Even in worldly life, to give love one must understand about the person or object that we love. Similarly, only by understanding the principle, the feeling of love towards <em>Bhagavan</em> deepens. Depending on our knowledge our emotions get entangled. Various scriptures and mythology of India explain the different aspects of <em>Bhagavan</em>, which help the feeling of love to deepen. The Universe as a whole is woven by love. <em>Bhakti</em> cannot be explained because it is a feeling. The path towards that feeling is knowledge and it can be explained. Only faith induces a person to attain knowledge. In this article, three sanskrit terms are used throughout for the ease of explanation. They are <em>bhakta</em> (devotee), <em>bhakti</em> (devotion) and <em>Bhagavan</em> (God).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Complete love for <em>Bhagavan</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Knowledge gives feeling. If the knowledge attained is incorrect, then the feeling and emotion changes. When the knowledge attained about <em>Bhagavan</em> is incorrect, our feelings towards Him changes. Likewise, when we have desire for worldly objects it tempts us to have knowledge about that object, and naturally the love for that object increases and the love for <em>Bhagavan</em> decreases. It is impossible to have complete love for both, that is towards objects and <em>Bhagavan</em>, equally. The love is divided between the object and <em>Bhagavan</em>. Therefore the love for Bhagavan is whole only when the love for object is discarded. Complete love towards <em>Bhagavan</em> is called <em>purna</em> <em>bhakti</em>. When the love for <em>Bhagavan</em> is complete, then the mind is content because the mind is linked to the highest principle, <em>Bhagavan</em>. The mind will not be content when there is love towards the worldly objects because, worldly objects are not complete and they have defects of some kind or other. Therefore, the mind cannot remain in the content state for long. When the desire for one worldly object is satisfied, the desire for the other one creeps in the mind. Therefore, only complete <em>bhakti</em> towards <em>Bhagavan</em> can satisfy the mind permanently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Bhakti</em> is a goal by itself; it is not a path towards the goal. <em>Purna bhakti</em> (complete love for <em>Bhagavan</em>) is the goal by itself. If the <em>bhakti</em> is distracted by worldly desires, then the <em>bhakti</em> is not complete and it becomes a mere path. <em>Purna</em> <em>bhakti</em> leads to complete knowledge about the highest principle. Therefore, <em>purna</em> <em>bhakti</em> is the goal and divided <em>bhakti</em> is the path towards the goal. A true <em>bhakta</em> will have unflickering love towards <em>Bhagavan</em>. According to the <em>bhakti</em> culture, there are different shades or stages of <em>bhakti</em>.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>In the initial stage of <em>bhakti</em>, the <em>bhakti</em> is not complete. The <em>bhakta</em> has desire for worldly objects and his <em>bhakti</em> is divided between the worldly desires and <em>Bhagavan</em>. He worships <em>Bhagavan</em> to attain his desires and to protect him from his difficulties. He forgets <em>Bhagavan</em> in the period of success. Sometimes, he also feels that <em>Bhagavan</em> is giving him difficulties to test him and he worships to evade those difficulties. Some <em>bhaktas</em> worship <em>Bhagavan</em> even after they attain success; however their goal is not to attain <em>Bhagavan</em> but to attain more worldly objects. Their only aim is <em>sukha prapti</em> (attaining pleasures) and <em>dukha nivritti</em> (freedom from difficulties). They prefer to remain in this state of <em>bhakti</em> throughout their life. They believe that <em>Bhagavan</em> is the giver of the riches. They believe in karma and rituals and they realize that <em>Bhagavan&#8217;s</em> blessing is needed for a bright future.</li>
<li>In the next stage, the <em>bhakta</em> feels that his goal is <em>Bhagavan</em> and not the worldly object, but he feels that his goal (<em>Bhagavan</em>) is entirely different from him. He does not have any other desire in life, but still he feels that there is a need to attain his goal. This <em>bhakti</em> is called the <em>niskama bhakti</em> (desireless <em>bhakti</em>). They have complete love towards <em>Bhagavan</em>, still they feel their goal is separate from them. Many divine luminaries prefer to remain in this state for the simple reason that they love the intense feeling of love towards <em>Bhagavan</em>. In this stage, they assume a relationship between themselves and <em>Bhagavan</em>, assuming <em>Bhagavan</em> as their friend, master, parent, child etc. Most of the mythology and <em>puranas</em> like Siva <em>purana</em>, stories of Alwars etc are based on this type of <em>bhakti</em>.</li>
<li>In the final stage, love for <em>Bhagavan</em> is complete and undivided, and the <em>bhakta</em> feels that he is not different from that highest principle, <em>Bhagavan</em>. Premature <em>bhakti</em> at the initial stages intensifies and leads him to this non-dual state. At this stage, <em>bhakti</em> is the goal. He feels that &#8220;I am the non-dual principle&#8221;. He also feels that he is not different from the other beings. He understands the whole creation. This is absolute love and here the <em>sadhaka</em> (devotee) becomes the <em>sadhyam</em> (goal). He feels that &#8220;All are spiritual beings like him, have different intellect, and live in different physical bodies&#8221;. This is called <em>sadhya</em> <em>bhakti</em> (<em>bhakti</em> as the goal).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">The foregoing paragraphs explain the three different stages of <em>bhakti</em>. A true <em>bhakta</em> has to travel through all these stages to understand the true nature of <em>Bhagavan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><em>Bhakti</em></strong><strong> associated with <em>gunas</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Everyone express their <em>bhakti</em> according to their <em>gunas</em> (quality). There are three types of <em>gunas</em> &#8211; <em>sattva, rajas</em> and <em>tamas</em> and the <em>bhakti</em> varies according to the respective <em>guna</em>. People with <em>sattva</em> <em>guna</em> express their <em>bhakti</em> in a very soft and unassuming manner like uttering <em>slokas</em>, silent meditation on the form of <em>Bhagavan</em>, reading and hearing about the glories of <em>Bhagavan</em>, performing rituals and <em>yagas</em> of <em>satvika</em> nature etc. People with <em>rajasika</em> nature express their love for <em>Bhagavan</em> in a more aggressive way by performing animal sacrifices, practicing rituals which are aggressive and they even go to the extent of injuring themselves to express their <em>bhakti</em>. This is otherwise called <em>Kora bhakti</em>. <em>Tamasika bhakti</em> is a lower level of <em>bhakti</em> or <em>bhakti</em> practiced by very immatured people. They imagine that <em>Bhagavan</em> is a person like themselves and they offer things to <em>Bhagavan</em> according to their practices and nature. There are <em>tamasika bhaktas</em> who even offer toddy and cigars to <em>Bhagavan</em>, assuming that <em>Bhagavan</em> will accept these objects and help them in their progress and prosperity. Sometimes, <em>bhakti</em> which is aggressive in nature appear to be very cruel, however the <em>bhaktas</em> are so obsessed with their love for <em>Bhagavan</em> and they do not realize the aggressive nature of their <em>bhakti</em>. Like this, according to their inherent nature each one expresses their <em>bhakti</em> accordingly. There is nothing wrong in any type of worship and rituals, however, a wise person will only prefer a higher form of <em>bhakti</em>. People with rajasika and tamasika nature take time to understand the true nature of <em>Bhagavan</em>. Mostly people with <em>rajasika</em> and <em>tamasika</em> nature worship <em>Bhagavan</em> for material comforts, whereas, people with <em>sattvika</em> nature, if their <em>bhakti</em> is pure they will pass on to the next stage to <em>nishkama bhakti</em> with ease. Even if it is for the simple reason of attaining the worldly objects, if their <em>bhakti</em> is of the pure nature, it purifies the mind in which the higher principle is grasped. In the advanced stages of <em>sakama satvika bhakti</em> ( <em>bhakti</em> with desires) they train the mind to attain <em>Bhagavan</em>. Their bhakti transforms the weakness in their gunas and helps them to attain <em>Bhagavan</em>. This is called <em>guna parivarthana</em>. The invocation mantra of the Mundaka Upanisad is a <em>guna</em> <em>parivarthana mantra</em>, where one worships God for <em>guna parivarthana</em> to grasp the Truth. The mantra goes like this, &#8220;O Gods, may we hear only good things with our ears. O Gods, may we see only good things with our eyes. May we praise You with our body and all our organs steady. And may we live this life as long as the Gods decree. Peace for all&#8221;. People who have <em>nishkama</em> <em>bhakti</em> express their <em>bhakti</em> in the most humble and <em>sattvic </em>form.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><em>Vairagyam</em></strong><strong> (discrimination) and <em>ishvara jnanam</em> (knowledge of Baghavan)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In worldly life, when we meet a person for the first time, probably we will not experience any feeling. When we come to know more of that person we develop a feeling towards him. The same principle is used here. When we understand the nature of <em>Bhagavan</em> we automatically develop a feeling towards <em>Bhagavan</em>. The nature of <em>Bhagavan</em> does not change at all, only our understanding about Him increases slowly with <em>bhakti</em>. At present, we have knowledge about the worldly objects. Moreover, our feeling towards the worldly object changes constantly. Human mind cannot stick to any one object for a long time. At one stage of life, some objects give happiness to us. At another stage of life the same object is of least importance to us. For example, in our childhood stage dolls use to fancy us, but the feeling towards dolls is not the same in our adulthood. Likewise, an object that seems to be important to one person may be hated by another person. Therefore, the love for worldly objects changes with different persons and also at different stages. At one stage, we overcome the love for worldly objects and become obsessed with divine love. This leads to <em>nishkama bhakti</em>. We will feel that the affinity to <em>Bhagavan</em> by thoughts is more peaceful than the affinity towards objects. Desire is a mere illusion and is based on the mentality of a person. When <em>bhakti</em> intensifies a <em>bhakta</em> will realize that no objects can satisfy his desire other than the presence of <em>Bhagavan</em>. He develops <em>vairagya</em> (discrimination) towards objects. This is the juncture where <em>guna parivarthanam</em> happens in a person. Now the <em>bhakta&#8217;s sadhana</em> (practice) becomes the <em>sadhyam</em> (goal). Till then, his mind will be fluctuating between <em>Bhagavan</em> and worldly objects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There are two types of causes (<em>karanam</em>). They are <em>nimitta karanam</em> and <em>upadana karanam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Nimitta karanam</em> &#8211; In <em>Nimitta karanam,</em> there is an agent in between the cause and the effect. For example, for the material gold to become ornaments, the work of the goldsmith is inevitable. Here the goldsmith is the agent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Upadana karanam</em> &#8211; In <em>Upadana karanam,</em> the cause becomes the effect without an agent. For example, the spider builds its web by itself. It does not need any external material or help to build its web.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The universe is formed by the <em>upadana karanam</em>. The Consciousness uses its own power called <em>maya</em> to bring out this universe. Consciousness (<em>Bhagavan</em>) is manifested as the universe. This world is not separate from <em>Bhagavan</em>. He has become all. He does not have any name (<em>anami</em>) and any form (<em>arupi</em>). Only his manifestation has name and form for the sake of diversity. A wise person is not aware of the diversity and always aware of the underlying unity. He may be engaged in worldly activities but he is aware of his non-dual nature. He works for the sake of work and not for any personal gains. <em>Vairagyam</em> (discrimination) and <em>ishvara jnanam</em> (knowledge about <em>Bhagavan</em>) leads one to <em>nishkama bhakti</em> (desireless <em>bhakti</em>). A <em>nishkama</em> <em>bhakta</em> is a <em>karma</em> yogi. His mind is deeply rooted in the highest principle; still he works like an ordinary person. Success and failure do not bother him. He identifies himself with the highest principle and he becomes a <em>jnana</em> yogi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Rituals and feelings</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Bhakti</em> is mostly involved with rituals like pooja, sacred offerings etc. One performs a <em>pooja</em> with rituals and some <em>pooja</em> materials like flowers, incense sticks, some vessels etc. If <em>bhakti</em> is a feeling, then what is the need for rituals? If it is a ritual, then what is the importance of the feeling in <em>bhakti</em>? The answers to both the questions are, feeling and rituals -both lead to <em>bhakti</em>. If one has a divine feeling, he must express it; else that feeling will fade away. It is recommended to practice <em>bhakti</em> with rituals else the feeling of <em>bhakti</em> will fade away at initial stages. When <em>bhakti</em> intensifies there is no need for rituals. At one stage, <em>bhakta</em> will feel that rituals are a distraction for his <em>bhakti</em>. He feels that it is so artificial to offer <em>pooja</em> to his Self. At this stage he has reached the stage of <em>nishkama bhakti</em>. Till then rituals are needed to support his feelings. A <em>bhakta</em> should not ignore the rituals for the sake of lack of time or due to laziness. Under such circumstances the <em>bhakti</em> will get stagnated. If a <em>bhakta</em> does not believe in a particular type of ritual, he can opt for another type of ritual. However, rituals definitely enhance the feeling of <em>bhakti</em>. At the sametime, rituals performed without any deep feeling will not enhance the feeling of <em>bhakti</em>. Therefore, rituals are important to enhance the feeling of <em>bhakti</em> provided it is done with concentration and a deep feeling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><em>Saranagathi tattva</em></strong><strong> (total surrender)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Saranagathi tattva</em> is an important concept in <em>bhakti</em> yoga. One needs tremendous energy to run life smoothly in spite of the difficulties and obstacles in life. Even to forgive others we need energy. The mind will be continuously distracting us from our goal. We need energy to direct the mind towards the goal. A <em>bhakta</em> when he totally surrenders his everything to <em>Bhagavan</em>, he is relieved from his worries and he gains energy from <em>Bhagavan</em> to run his life smoothly. <em>Bhagavan</em> is the highest principle and when we connect with Him, His energy flows to us. As explained before, one should give love to receive love in return. One should also be able to recognize the love one receives in various forms. Only then he can be a content and happy person. When a <em>bhakta</em> gives unconditional love towards <em>Bhagavan</em>, he receives that love in return in various forms. This makes the <em>nishkama bhakta</em> a content and happy person. Human emotions take different forms to receive love from different relationships as father, mother, child, brother, boss, lover, teacher and so on. A <em>bhakta</em> assumes <em>Bhagavan</em> in one of these relations and he receives love in that form of relationship. Each relationship is important to us in each stage of life. At the infant stage parents are important to a person. At the childhood, parents and friends are important. At the adulthood, teacher is also important and like this at different stages each relationship becomes more important. If the <em>bhakta</em> misses any one relationship in that stage, he assumes <em>Bhagavan</em> as that relation and enjoys the feeling of that relationship with <em>Bhagavan</em> in that form. <em>Bhakti</em> fills his relationship. He opens his mind to <em>Baghavan</em> in that form of relationship. He will be relieved of his worries and sometimes receives answers for his problems also. Such pure love makes the mind matured for the next stage of <em>bhakti</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><em>Bhakti</em></strong><strong> comforts in different forms</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Bhakti</em> gives mental strength and <em>jnana</em>. At some phase of our life all must have faced some trying situations and difficulties. Those thoughts continuously haunt us and retard our progress in life. These negative thoughts will result in loss of intelligence and make us a dull person or a revengeful person. Bhakti helps us to divert from the haunting thoughts. <em>Bhakti</em> helps us to fill ourselves with faith and love.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Bhakti</em> makes us to follow the right act (<em>dharma</em>). The teachings of <em>Bhagavan</em> in the concerned form purify the mind. Any action will definitely give result. The result of the action done with <em>bhakti</em> is <em>puniya</em> (positive effect). The experiences in life are the result of the actions done in the past. Experiences are of two types &#8211; <em>praballah prarabhda</em> (their results cannot be changed) and <em>durbalah prarabhda</em> (results can be changed to an extent). Prior to any action, thought of that action arises in the mind. If that thought is encouraged then it will result in the action. If the thoughts are not encouraged then they will fade away. Due to our negative karmas sometimes negative thoughts arise in the mind. Immediately, if they are counteracted by positive thoughts of <em>bhakti</em>, it will not lead to negative action. Suppose they are not counteracted by positive thoughts, the negative thoughts will lead to negative action and one has to experience their consequences. <em>Bhakti</em> can dispel the negative actions in the thought state itself. This is how the <em>durbalah prarabhda</em> is dispelled. However at times, there will be no time between the thought and action or we will not be aware of the thought itself. Everything will happen before we could react. Situation will be out of our control. This is the result of <em>praballah prarabhdah</em>. In such situations, <em>bhakti</em> will help to have mental strength to face any situation. When we experience the result of our positive karmas (action), <em>bhakti</em> helps us to gain mental stability and makes us a humble person.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As said earlier, when <em>bhakti</em> intensifies <em>bhakta</em> realizes <em>Bhagavan</em> as the highest principle. He realizes that <em>Bhagavan</em> as the <em>upadhana karana</em> of this universe, which means that the entire universe is not different from <em>Bhagavan</em>. Now the <em>bhakta</em> attains the status of <em>Viswarupa</em> <em>Bhakta</em>. He visualizes <em>Bhagavan</em> in all beings. He finds no difference between the different forms. He does not encourage enmity with anyone. Mind matures by his <em>Viswarupa bhakti</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><em>Nirguna Brahma bhakta</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The mind matures at each step. Now the <em>bhakta</em> realizes that <em>Bhagavan</em> is his Innerself, Atma. He does Atma <em>vichara</em> and attains <em>advaita jnana</em>, which is called <em>para bhakti</em>. He does not find difference between <em>Bhagavan</em> and himself. Duality induces fear of some kind or other towards <em>Bhagavan</em> like <em>Bhagavan</em> punishing the <em>bhakta</em>, expecting <em>Bhagavan</em> to take revenge on the <em>bhakta&#8217;s</em> enemies etc. These are all <em>bhakti</em> of the lower level. When the <em>bhakta</em> realizes the non-dual nature of <em>Bhagavan</em> he becomes an <em>advaiti</em> and he attains <em>videha mukti</em> (liberation in his life time itself). Thus <em>bhakti</em> yoga leads to the goal. <em>Bhakti</em> yoga is path towards the goal as well as the goal itself. It all depends on how one view <em>Bhagavan</em>.</p>

<h4>                                                                            KARMA YOGA</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">A human being is the combination of the five basic elements in the universe namely the space, air, fire, water and earth.  However, these basic elements alone will not make a human being.  His body is the combination of these basic elements.  In reality, a human being is a conscious being with unlimited power.  He is guided by his <i>karmas (</i>actions<i>)</i>.  Even though a person is identified by his body, he is respected and valued by his nature (<i>svabhava</i>), actions (<i>karma</i>) and behaviour.  A person&#8217;s nature and attitude in life is pivotal in doing the actions.  A person has an opportunity to become rude and cruel by his attitude and actions, and at the same time he has the opportunity to become kind and affectionate by his attitude and actions.  Among all the creations in the world, only man has the rare opportunity to know his Self.  A person&#8217;s nature changes according to his knowledge.  According to the knowledge, the <i>bhavana</i> (attitude) of the mind changes and the action also changes accordingly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Inspite of all the materialistic knowledge and technical skills in the world, a person does not know to lead his life in peace.  His external knowledge has given him ego (<i>ahankara</i>) and as a result his actions have led him to injustice and various sins.  He earns and spends his valuable earnings in the most <i>adharmic</i> way.  He lacks knowledge in <i>dharma</i> (justice) and <i>adharma</i> (injustice), in <i>sat</i> (reality) and <i>asat</i> (non-reality).  Knowledge to lead life and to reach the goal is given in the vedas and this is <i>Karma yoga</i>.  Without understanding this basic principle, people assume everything as predestined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Every being is a conscious being, Atma, covered by the combination of the basic elements, the body.  The path which makes one understand that he is Atma, is <i>dharma</i>.  Till the Atma realizes that it is separate from the body, it takes repeated births.  <i>Adharma</i> denies one from this knowledge.  <i>Karma</i> (action) arises from body (<i>kayikam</i>), speech (<i>vachikam</i>) and mind (<i>manasam</i>).  If a person&#8217;s soul is hurt, the whole world will get its impact, the only thing is we are not able to realize it.  It happens because Atma is non-dual.  For example, if there is a wound in the head, the whole body is aware of it.  In the same way, when a person is hurt or insulted, it will have an impact in the universal mind.  All <i>karmas</i> will have a reason, but all reasons will not lead to <i>karma</i>.  <i>Karmas</i> will have bondage, but reasons will not have bondage.  <i>Karmas</i> will lead to result and attachment.  If the result is in the form of comforts, wealth, name and fame, honour etc, then it will lead to desire and gradually to attachment.  Repeatedly we perform <i>karma</i> to satisfy the desires and it gradually leaves likes (<i>raga</i>) and dislikes (<i>dvesha</i>) in a person, which is the seed for the next birth.  <i>Karma</i> does not erase desires, it leaves likes and dislikes in the mind.  The world is in the mind and not outside.  A person&#8217;s wealth, relatives, position, or status will not be with him till the end.  Only his mind remains with him till the end and so mind should be taken utmost care.  The difficulties of the body are till the death, it is <i>Maya</i>, but the mind travels beyond death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When we perform <i>karma</i>, it leaves behind the likes and dislikes of that <i>karma</i>, which influences to accept or reject the next <i>karma</i>.  When we perform an action by <i>karma yoga</i>, it removes the likes and dislikes.  When we have likes and dislikes, the actions are affected by it.  The likes and dislikes lead to <i>moha</i> (passion) and it covers the discriminative power.  It reduces the understanding power of an action.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Vedanta says that attitude (<i>bhavana</i>) is important in performing an action and this is <i>karma yoga</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>Karma</i> (actions) can be categorized as many types.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>
<i>Nitya karma</i> or <i>niyatham karma</i> &#8211; daily duties</li>
<li>
<i>Kamya karma</i> &#8211; desire prompted duties</li>
<li>
<i>Naimittika karma</i> or <i>prayachita karma</i> &#8211; duties on special occasions</li>
<li>
<i>Nishida karma</i> or <i>vi-karma</i> &#8211; actions to be avoided</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">Attitude of a person is important while performing an action as well experiencing the result.  The attitude defines a person.  Since attitude is dependent on the <i>bhuddhi</i> (intellect), karma yoga is also known as <i>bhuddhi</i> yoga.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>&#8221; Thy right is to work only, but never to its fruits; let the fruit of action be not thy motive, nor let thy attachment be to inaction&#8221;</i>  Gita, verse (2,47).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The above verse explains four points</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>One has the right to do an action.  Each action has a choice.  To deal with a particular situation is our choice.</li>
<li>Once an action is done, there is no choice for the result.  One cannot decide on the result.  Once an action is done, the law of nature takes the responsibility to return the result.</li>
<li>The law of nature returns the result based on the attitude of our action.  Our attitude is dependent on our knowledge.</li>
<li>Sometimes failure makes us weak.  We hesitate to venture in to an action with the fear of facing failure.  Attachment to inactivity should be avoided.  The inherent <i>gunas</i> (nature) in a person will not allow a person to remain ideal.  Each one has a particular <i>guna</i> and a person does an action according to his <i>guna</i>.  A person can remain ideal externally; however his mind will be always active and planning about actions.  The existing impressions of likes and dislikes make a person to perform actions.  At the same time, one should not fight and complain about failure.  The results are received according to the existing impressions.  Try to accept the result as it is with humble attitude.  One&#8217;s action must satisfy his values.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b>Attitude of a person while performing nitya karma(daily duties)</b></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>There should not be any likes or dislikes while performing the daily duties (either household or professional).  Equal importance must be given for the family, profession and society.  If one concentrates on the profession alone, ignoring the family and society, later on the family and society will ignore him.  If he gives importance to the family alone, then there will be no progress in the professional life.  If the society is ignored, he will remain as a stranger to the society.  Therefore, one must train himself to give equal importance for the family, profession and society.</li>
<li>When we do a favour to others, we normally expect gratitude from them.  In case, if they fail to show that gratitude, we feel hurt or insulted.  In reality, Atma is non-dual.  One is doing a favour to the Atma, and not to that particular person.  If that particular person does not return that gratitude, someone else will return that favour in time of our need.  Most of the time help comes to us from other sources and not from that particular person.  Therefore, one must do a favour with an attitude that &#8216;I am helping God&#8217; and this is called &#8220;Work is worship&#8221;.</li>
<li>Do not try to imitate others action, because an action is done efficiently according to one&#8217;s maturity and mentality.  A person is efficient in performing his own duty and performing others duty out of jealous or envy will not exhibit his own talent.</li>
<li>Once an action is done, there should not be any feeling of guilt, because feeling of guilt bothers the action and its result.  At the same time, if a wrong action is done then there should be a feeling of guilt because it helps us correct our actions.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">When an action is done with these points in mind, it definitely removes the likes and dislikes.  <i>Sastra</i> says that in addition to these, a householder is advised to do some additional duties &#8211; <i>Yagna, dhana</i> and <i>tapas</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There are five different types of <b><i>yagna</i></b> to be performed by a householder.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>
<i>Deva yagna</i> &#8211; It is the daily prayer offered to God for a period of ten to fifteen minutes.  It relaxes the mind, keeps it stable and instil a value of detachment and selfishness.  It purifies the mind and prepares one for a higher state of spiritual advancement.</li>
<li>
<i>Rishi yagna</i> &#8211; Gratitude must be shown to the <i>rishis</i> because they revealed us the Truth.  Gratitude is shown by learning their scriptures and attending <i>satsang</i> (spiritual discussions).</li>
<li>
<i>Pitru yagna</i> &#8211; It is the duty to be done to the ancestors, parents and elderly people in the family.  The elders in the family should take care of the youngsters in the family.  When the youngsters grow up, it is their turn to take care of the elders (by that time they will be very old) and the younger ones.  This cycle must go on forever.  Even a few kind and affectionate words from the youngsters will give a lot of happiness to the elders, especially the very old people.</li>
<li>
<i>Manushya yagna</i> &#8211; The relatives and guests coming to our place of living must be taken care and respected.  They have to be treated carefully and fed well.</li>
<li>
<i>Bhuta yagna</i> &#8211; It is the gratitude shown towards the nature for helping us to survive.  It includes the worship of the five basic elements and the cow worship etc.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b><i>Dhanam</i></b> is sharing.  The important duty of the householder is, they have to serve the people of the other <i>ashramas</i> namely <i>brahmachari</i>, <i>vanaprastha</i> and <i>sanyasi</i>.  A householder should provide all the facilities for the students and allow them to concentrate on their studies.  By sharing, the desires and passion are reduced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b><i>Tapa</i></b> &#8211; We experience the outside world through the body, mind and <i>indriyas</i> (senses).  Controlling the mind and <i>indriyas</i> is <i>tapas</i>, by this we can experience the inner world.  <i>Tapas</i> helps to experience the inner Self.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b>The attitude of a person while performing <i>Kamya karma</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">These karmas are not part of the daily duties, but they are done as a part of entertainment.  <i>Dharma</i> should be followed in performing the <i>kamya karma</i>.  There should be a limit in performing the <i>kamya karma</i> and even this <i>karma</i> is to be reduced in due course of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b>The attitude of a person while performing the <i>prayachita karma</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">These karmas are usually performed as a remedy for the failures and difficulties in life.  It is better to accept the failure and learn from the mistakes, however if one feels to perform the <i>prayachita karmas</i>, then it should be accompanied with charity.  The <i>prayachita karma</i> differs according to the needs of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b>The attitude of the person while performing the <i>nishida karmas</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">These karmas are improper karmas.  With the attitude that such karmas disturb the family and society, they are to be abandoned.  Even some negative emotions like anger, jealous, criticism are considered as nishida karma and it should be avoided.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Bhagavad Gita advises <i>karma yoga</i>.  One enjoys the <i>karma</i> and is least considered about the result.  Therefore, there is no failure or success.  The attitude behind the action is very important.  <i>Karma yoga</i> does not leave the impression of likes and dislikes.  A person who does <i>karma</i> <i>yoga</i> has a clear goal and his action is not wavered by success or failure.  His stable mind induces him to jhana yoga, which is the next step towards liberation.  A <i>Karma yogi</i> renounces the mind and do not renounce his actions.  <i>Karma yoga</i> is the mean and not the end.  It leads a person to liberation by erasing his ego (<i>ahankara</i>), desire, anger and hatred towards others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This is the essence of <i>karma yoga</i> as explained in Baghavad Gita.</p>
