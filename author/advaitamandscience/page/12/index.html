<h4 style="text-align: center"><strong>Desires and Renunciation </strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">Renunciation is another misunderstood concept of Vedanta. Renunciation does not mean to sacrifice everything and live like a mendicant in a secluded forest. Renunciation is a state of mind which gives peace and happiness. In Bhagavad Gita, Baghavan Krishna says to renounce the results of action than to renounce the action itself. &#8220;Perform action, O Arjuna, being steadfast in yoga, abandoning attachment and balanced in success and failure. Evenness of mind is called yoga&#8221;, Bhagavad Gita, (2, 48). Attachment towards the desire covers the power of the mind. Renunciation helps the mind to become free of attachment. Renunciation is an idea of the mind to move towards perfection. Swami Boomananda Thirtha says, &#8220;Renunciation is safeguarding the mind and intelligence from getting afflicted by the result of the action. Renunciation helps one to realize the Truth which is hidden behind success and failure. Renunciation is attained by knowledge. Senses are used to gather external knowledge and so senses are always turned outwards. Knowledge about the Self makes the senses turn inwards, and this is renunciation. Automatically the mind and senses shows displeasure towards the external objects&#8221;. In the modern world, many people concentrate on the result and they give least importance for the action. Ancient wisdom tells to concentrate on the action and the result will follow automatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Renunciation gives self-contentment. It is a common idea that success gives happiness and contentment. If this is true, then all the successful people must be content and happy. In our experience we notice that even successful people are not content and they are deluded at times. Their success is short lived. When they attain a success they are after another success and there is always a struggle to retain the attained success. Therefore even the successful people are not content. This implies that success alone cannot give happiness. The object we wish to attain, situation, or events are the manifestation of the Consciousness. Any manifestation is dependent on its source and it cannot give complete happiness. Inspite of whatever we attain we still have a feeling of &#8216;wanting more&#8217;. Any pleasure is an evolute of the Consciousness and not the derivative of the action. Therefore, contentment and pleasure are based on the Self and not on the external objects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">According to Taittriya upanisad there are three stages of pleasure. When we merely look at an object of desire we experience a pleasure. It is called <em>priya vritti</em> or <em>ishta vastu darshana janya vritti</em>. The next stage is when we attain that object of desire we experience a pleasure. It is called <em>moda vritti</em> or <em>ishta vastu</em> <em>labham janya vritti</em>. The next stage is when we enjoy that object after attaining it we experience a pleasure. It is called <em>pramoda vritti</em> or <em>anubhava janya vritti</em>. In these three stages of pleasure, the external objects are only a stimulation to create pleasure in us. Actually, pleasure is derived from Atma. Pleasure is a state of inner happiness. Atma is infinite and it is blissful. Mind is the expression of the Atma. However, mind experiences a glimpse of this bliss only when it experiences the pleasure stimulated by the external objects. In the pure state, mind reflects the exact nature of Atma. Due to <em>maya</em> (delusion), <em>raga</em> (attachment) and <em>dvesha</em> (aversion) are created in the mind. <em>Raga</em> and <em>dvesha</em> are impressions in the mind which are created by our judgment of the external objects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Impressions of past actions from the past birth as well as the present birth are accumulated in the mind. Our present actions are based on these accumulated impressions. The impressions of <em>raga</em> (attachment) and <em>dvesha</em> (aversion) intimidate us in the present actions. However, by knowledge we can control the mind against the <em>raga</em> and <em>dvesha</em>. One need not succumb to the intimidation. Passion and aversion both can lead a person to perform sinful action. It affects a person in different stages of life. In Bhagavad Gita, Baghavan Krishna says, &#8220;Attachment and aversion for the objects of the senses abide in the senses, let none come under their sway, for they are his foes. It is desire, anger born of the quality of rajas, all-devouring, all-sinful; know this as the foe in this world. O Arjuna, wisdom is enveloped by this constant enemy of the wise in the form of desire, which is unappeasable as fire&#8217; Bhagavad Gita, (3- 34, 37, 39).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Bhuddhi</em> always determines according to the attained knowledge (<em>viveka</em>), however, the mind focuses on raga and <em>dvesha</em> and thinks accordingly. <em>Bhuddhi</em> studies a matter, understands its implication and evaluate them with deep insight. An action is an outward expression of our knowledge. When <em>bhuddhi</em> introspect, knowledge becomes deep. The dimension of the mind is infinite. Each thought is the expression of the mind. Along with the thought emotion also arises. If we do not follow the thought the emotion becomes weak. When a negative thought arises in the mind it should be ignored and if a positive thought arises in the mind it should be followed. In Bhagavad Gita, Baghavan Krishna says, &#8220;One should raise oneself by one&#8217;s Self alone; let not one lower oneself, for the Self alone is the friend of oneself and the Self alone is the enemy of oneself&#8221;, (6, 5). One must elevate the Self by his own intrinsic power. One should never degrade the Self in any circumstance because Self is one&#8217;s true friend. The mind of a person depends on the thoughts he encourage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Devotion is one of the ways to erase negative thoughts. Devotion is a feeling generated by the mind mostly due to fear. When one thinks of the consequences of a negative situation, due to fear a feeling is generated towards God. However, true devotion is a feeling created towards God due to unconditional love. Only by knowledge one can attain the pure devotional thoughts. Mind is the result of the transformation of Reality. Reality is traced back by introspection. Attachment, hatred, misery, feeling, emotions are the play of the mind. To get relief from them is also another play of the mind. When mind is purified by <em>sadhana</em> (practice), it reflects Consciousness and these impurities are dispelled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Ideas and desires proceed from the mind, subsist in the mind and terminate in the mind. Lord Krishna says, &#8220;Senses are superior to the object. Mind reigns above the senses, and intelligence is still superior. But the Self is still loftier (It is the real identity of man)&#8221;, Bhagavad Gita, (3, 42). Senses attract the objects. Therefore the senses are superior to the object. The mind either selects or rejects the objects. Therefore the mind is superior to the object and the senses. Intelligence can guide the mind to act accordingly. The feelings and emotions of the mind are controlled by the intelligence and so it is superior. An individual&#8217;s attitude and aim are determined by the intelligence. Intelligence directs the mind and so it is superior. Atma is the base of senses, mind and intelligence. Atma is <em>akartritva</em> (non-doer) and <em>abhoktritva</em> (non-enjoyer). No vibration or action takes place in Atma. It is omnipresent. Mind relies on its infinite power. Desire lies in the mind and not in the objects. Repeated thinking makes the desires more strong. In Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna asks Bhagavan Krishna, no one really likes or prefers sin; still many people are performing sinful acts. What is the reason for this? Bhagavan Krishna replies, (This verse is repeated again for clarity) &#8220;It is the desire, it is the anger born of the quality of rajas, all-devouring, all-sinful; know this as foe in this world. OArjuna, wisdom is enveloped by this constant enemy of the wise in the form of desire, which is unappeasable as fire. The senses, the mind and the intellect are said to be its seat; through these it (desire) deludes the embodied by veiling his wisdom. Therefore OArjuna, controlling the senses first, do thou kill this sinful thing (desire), the destroyer of knowledge and realization&#8221;, Bhagavad Gita, (3-37, 39, 40, 41).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The three common and basic desires which are common with people are the desire for progeny, desire for wealth and desire for name and fame (recognition). There is absolutely nothing wrong in desiring for these, however if the mind becomes a slave to these desires, then it will ruin the personality. If there is a mind, then there will be definitely thoughts. The problem is not the thoughts. The problem is the thoughts affecting the personality. True renunciation of desires is the ability to balance the thoughts, that is to consider the necessary thoughts and at the same time not getting affected by them. Unnecessary thoughts are completely ignored. One must not allow the events, situations, persons or object to rule the mind and <em>bhuddhi</em>. The Atma must rule the mind and this is the law of the nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Renunciation of desires is an inner enrichment. It instills a strong, sublime, inner renunciation towards every kind of gain and loss, freeing the mind from all types of doubts and concern for success and failure. Only spiritual wisdom has the power to bring this inner freedom. When a person understands his real nature, he overcomes the attraction and repulsion of the mind. Emotional conflicts, turmoil and mental tortures are the creation of the mind. Conflict is the disparity of the mind between what it wishes to see and what it sees. Every conflict will have a solution. Only by <em>viveka</em> (discrimination of good and bad) it can be derived from the depth of the <em>bhuddhi</em>. Mind should be calm and composed to discriminate between the good and bad. In Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna was in delusion and wanted to quit from the battlefield just before the battle was about to commence. He trained himself vigorously for thirteen years for this battle with all dedication and effort. Conflict of the mind was his biggest obstacle to do his duty of saving his nation from injustice rendered by his relatives. At this juncture, the right advice of <em>Bhagavan</em> Krishna dispelled his mental conflict and he regained the mental strength by his advice. At that juncture, mental strength is more pivotal to him than his talent to win the battle. This incredible advice to Arjuna on discrimination, right judgment and understanding of the Atma is today revered by the humanity as the &#8220;Holy Bhagavad Gita&#8221;. In fact, Bhagavad Gita is a mental science. It is not addressed to any particular religion or creed. Jawaharlal Nehru said, &#8220;During the 2,500 years since it was written, Indian humanity has gone repeatedly though the processes of change and development and decay; but it has always found something living in the Gita&#8230;. The message of the Gita is not sectarian or addressed to any particular school of thought. It is universal in its approach for everyone&#8230;.&#8217;All paths lead to ME&#8217;, it says&#8221; Jawaharlal Nehru, former Indian prime minister (as quoted in the daily &#8216;The Hindu&#8217;, on January 30, 2015). <em>Bhagavan</em> Krishna&#8217;s advice brought inner renunciation in Arjuna. <em>Bhagavan</em> Krishna advised that renunciation does not mean shunning from activity. It is rather doing the duty without ego, working with a universal vision, and working for humanity. Renunciation is actually an expansion of the mind from being a selfish person.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Self knowledge empowers the mind and intellect from being a slave to worldly pleasures. It is not knowledge to be exclusively imparted to a <em>sanyasi</em> living in a secluded forest. It is common knowledge and this knowledge is imparted to any person interested in real freedom. Mind always mixes the present situation with past and future. It draws many thoughts from the past and it also imagines about the future consequences. It brings all the related past information from the memory. It does not have an option to select the likes and dislikes from the memory. The past information of the likes and dislike affect the mind. As a result, it does not concentrate on the present. If the thoughts from the memory are not given attention then they will fade away and do not appear again. Mind has a tendency to think about consequences. If such thoughts are also unattended then they will fade away. Thus one can engage in worldly activities and remain undisturbed by them. If we attend to any thought then they will appear again and again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When a person interacts with the world, he is subject to verbal hurt, aggravation, rude treatment from others or there may be disappointments about his life. Only this ancient wisdom, Vedanta or Self knowledge makes us realize that these are all different varieties of play of the mind and makes one realize that the Atma (I) is different from the vagaries of the mind. When our mind is disturbed we also disturb others surrounding us. An aggravated mind takes revenge on others. Only by <em>viveka</em>, <em>sama</em> (sublimity of the mind), <em>samadhana</em> (composure), <em>dama</em> (control of the senses) one can rule the mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">These ideas and concepts are derived from various Indian scriptures and the writings of eminent vedantists. One should do <em>nididhyasana</em> (introspection) on these ideas only then this knowledge becomes our knowledge. Introspection makes the mind to expand. Introspection is applying intelligence to understand spiritual propositions. It helps us to assimilate the spiritual truths. When the knowledge is assimilated it becomes a part of the being. When the knowledge becomes our own, we express it by thoughts, words and action. Whatever we assimilate it becomes our nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Ancient wisdom of spiritual science dispels the differences and vagaries of the mind and helps one to remain at peace under all odd situations. This wisdom when practiced will make the world more peaceful. Therefore, Ancient wisdom of Vedanta is absolutely needed for the modern world.</p>

					<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://advaitamandscience.org/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">Mar 9, 2015</span> | <a href="https://advaitamandscience.org/category/my-views/" rel="category tag">My Views</a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center">SELF- RELIANT AND SELF-RESPECT</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Self- reliant and self- respect have deep relationship and the relationship is not explicit. People who respect the self and disallow others to take advantage of them are the people who become independent in all aspects of life. Total independence means independent physically, mentally and financially. In my view, financial independence is the final decision, prior to that one must be physically and mentally independent to become a perfect self-reliant person.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Many people ignore physical and mental dependence. In fact, many are not aware of this dependence. People demand help from others thinking that it is their right to demand help from others. They forget the fact that by demanding physical help from others they are becoming dependent on others without their own knowledge. This is physical dependence. Likewise, many people are dependent on others ideas. They hesitate to take decisions of their own. In the name of consultation, they depend on others to take their decision. They depend on others advice and they fail to use their thinking capacity and they feel more comfortable with others ideas. This is mental dependence. Least importance is given for independence of thoughts. When we depend on others, the dependent person becomes weak and the helping person becomes powerful. When we become dependent, we lose our power to be self-reliant and gradually it reduces the self-respect. Being independent means it is not to ignore or disrespect others views and ideas. It means to give priority to our views and at the same time considering others views with equal respect. One must know to balance between the two.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In many homes, women are more dependent on others, especially mothers. They are dependent on other family members. They always take a back seat and they even hesitate to give their own views. They hesitate to take care of themselves. They feel that it is selfishness to care of themselves. This is a wrong notion. Only a self respecting mother can teach a child to become self- reliant. Some women allow themselves to be treated like a doormat and they blame others for their condition. It is true that some family situations cannot be avoided; however a large part lies on the ignorance of the concerned person and failing to establish the right as a human being. It is not a sacrifice to ignore ourselves. Instead, it is a sin. When we ignore ourselves, we are ignoring the divine power in us. Sacrifice is something that when we give it to others they will gain by it. When we give our self-respect, we lose it and others will not gain by it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There must be clear priorities in life. We must know our priorities then only life becomes useful. Helping others and getting help from others are common in life and it improves our relationship with others. However, it should not leave us in the dark. If we lose our self-respect we cannot become self-reliant, this leads to frustration and depression, and at one stage we will show displeasure to the same people whom we have helped or from whom we have received help. One must realize the purpose and importance of life. Every individual is born with a definite purpose and a person who realizes this will succeed easily.</p>

					<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://advaitamandscience.org/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">Feb 20, 2015</span> | <a href="https://advaitamandscience.org/category/articles/" rel="category tag">Articles</a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center">               BHAKTI YOGA</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> <em>Bhakti</em> (devotion) is an attitude of the mind and it is expressed in various ways. <em>Bhakti</em> is the pure form of love towards the highest principle, which is called &#8220;<em>Bhagavan</em>&#8221; (God). In fact, it is the love towards the highest principle, which does not have a name or form. Feeling is an important aspect of <em>bhakti</em> and only a peaceful mind can feel <em>bhakti</em>. To induce the feeling of <em>bhakti</em>, the highest principle without a name, form or quality is superimposed with name, form and quality. We superimpose limitations to the Infinite Consciousness with the help of our thoughts, and we call that feeling as <em>bhakti</em>. Pure Love is unconditional and unexpecting. If we expect something in return for our love towards <em>Bhagavan</em>, then it is not the pure <em>bhakti</em>. When we give love, we receive love in return. Even in worldly life, to give love one must understand about the person or object that we love. Similarly, only by understanding the principle, the feeling of love towards <em>Bhagavan</em> deepens. Depending on our knowledge our emotions get entangled. Various scriptures and mythology of India explain the different aspects of <em>Bhagavan</em>, which help the feeling of love to deepen. The Universe as a whole is woven by love. <em>Bhakti</em> cannot be explained because it is a feeling. The path towards that feeling is knowledge and it can be explained. Only faith induces a person to attain knowledge. In this article, three sanskrit terms are used throughout for the ease of explanation. They are <em>bhakta</em> (devotee), <em>bhakti</em> (devotion) and <em>Bhagavan</em> (God).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Complete love for <em>Bhagavan</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Knowledge gives feeling. If the knowledge attained is incorrect, then the feeling and emotion changes. When the knowledge attained about <em>Bhagavan</em> is incorrect, our feelings towards Him changes. Likewise, when we have desire for worldly objects it tempts us to have knowledge about that object, and naturally the love for that object increases and the love for <em>Bhagavan</em> decreases. It is impossible to have complete love for both, that is towards objects and <em>Bhagavan</em>, equally. The love is divided between the object and <em>Bhagavan</em>. Therefore the love for Bhagavan is whole only when the love for object is discarded. Complete love towards <em>Bhagavan</em> is called <em>purna</em> <em>bhakti</em>. When the love for <em>Bhagavan</em> is complete, then the mind is content because the mind is linked to the highest principle, <em>Bhagavan</em>. The mind will not be content when there is love towards the worldly objects because, worldly objects are not complete and they have defects of some kind or other. Therefore, the mind cannot remain in the content state for long. When the desire for one worldly object is satisfied, the desire for the other one creeps in the mind. Therefore, only complete <em>bhakti</em> towards <em>Bhagavan</em> can satisfy the mind permanently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Bhakti</em> is a goal by itself; it is not a path towards the goal. <em>Purna bhakti</em> (complete love for <em>Bhagavan</em>) is the goal by itself. If the <em>bhakti</em> is distracted by worldly desires, then the <em>bhakti</em> is not complete and it becomes a mere path. <em>Purna</em> <em>bhakti</em> leads to complete knowledge about the highest principle. Therefore, <em>purna</em> <em>bhakti</em> is the goal and divided <em>bhakti</em> is the path towards the goal. A true <em>bhakta</em> will have unflickering love towards <em>Bhagavan</em>. According to the <em>bhakti</em> culture, there are different shades or stages of <em>bhakti</em>.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>In the initial stage of <em>bhakti</em>, the <em>bhakti</em> is not complete. The <em>bhakta</em> has desire for worldly objects and his <em>bhakti</em> is divided between the worldly desires and <em>Bhagavan</em>. He worships <em>Bhagavan</em> to attain his desires and to protect him from his difficulties. He forgets <em>Bhagavan</em> in the period of success. Sometimes, he also feels that <em>Bhagavan</em> is giving him difficulties to test him and he worships to evade those difficulties. Some <em>bhaktas</em> worship <em>Bhagavan</em> even after they attain success; however their goal is not to attain <em>Bhagavan</em> but to attain more worldly objects. Their only aim is <em>sukha prapti</em> (attaining pleasures) and <em>dukha nivritti</em> (freedom from difficulties). They prefer to remain in this state of <em>bhakti</em> throughout their life. They believe that <em>Bhagavan</em> is the giver of the riches. They believe in karma and rituals and they realize that <em>Bhagavan&#8217;s</em> blessing is needed for a bright future.</li>
<li>In the next stage, the <em>bhakta</em> feels that his goal is <em>Bhagavan</em> and not the worldly object, but he feels that his goal (<em>Bhagavan</em>) is entirely different from him. He does not have any other desire in life, but still he feels that there is a need to attain his goal. This <em>bhakti</em> is called the <em>niskama bhakti</em> (desireless <em>bhakti</em>). They have complete love towards <em>Bhagavan</em>, still they feel their goal is separate from them. Many divine luminaries prefer to remain in this state for the simple reason that they love the intense feeling of love towards <em>Bhagavan</em>. In this stage, they assume a relationship between themselves and <em>Bhagavan</em>, assuming <em>Bhagavan</em> as their friend, master, parent, child etc. Most of the mythology and <em>puranas</em> like Siva <em>purana</em>, stories of Alwars etc are based on this type of <em>bhakti</em>.</li>
<li>In the final stage, love for <em>Bhagavan</em> is complete and undivided, and the <em>bhakta</em> feels that he is not different from that highest principle, <em>Bhagavan</em>. Premature <em>bhakti</em> at the initial stages intensifies and leads him to this non-dual state. At this stage, <em>bhakti</em> is the goal. He feels that &#8220;I am the non-dual principle&#8221;. He also feels that he is not different from the other beings. He understands the whole creation. This is absolute love and here the <em>sadhaka</em> (devotee) becomes the <em>sadhyam</em> (goal). He feels that &#8220;All are spiritual beings like him, have different intellect, and live in different physical bodies&#8221;. This is called <em>sadhya</em> <em>bhakti</em> (<em>bhakti</em> as the goal).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">The foregoing paragraphs explain the three different stages of <em>bhakti</em>. A true <em>bhakta</em> has to travel through all these stages to understand the true nature of <em>Bhagavan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><em>Bhakti</em></strong><strong> associated with <em>gunas</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Everyone express their <em>bhakti</em> according to their <em>gunas</em> (quality). There are three types of <em>gunas</em> &#8211; <em>sattva, rajas</em> and <em>tamas</em> and the <em>bhakti</em> varies according to the respective <em>guna</em>. People with <em>sattva</em> <em>guna</em> express their <em>bhakti</em> in a very soft and unassuming manner like uttering <em>slokas</em>, silent meditation on the form of <em>Bhagavan</em>, reading and hearing about the glories of <em>Bhagavan</em>, performing rituals and <em>yagas</em> of <em>satvika</em> nature etc. People with <em>rajasika</em> nature express their love for <em>Bhagavan</em> in a more aggressive way by performing animal sacrifices, practicing rituals which are aggressive and they even go to the extent of injuring themselves to express their <em>bhakti</em>. This is otherwise called <em>Kora bhakti</em>. <em>Tamasika bhakti</em> is a lower level of <em>bhakti</em> or <em>bhakti</em> practiced by very immatured people. They imagine that <em>Bhagavan</em> is a person like themselves and they offer things to <em>Bhagavan</em> according to their practices and nature. There are <em>tamasika bhaktas</em> who even offer toddy and cigars to <em>Bhagavan</em>, assuming that <em>Bhagavan</em> will accept these objects and help them in their progress and prosperity. Sometimes, <em>bhakti</em> which is aggressive in nature appear to be very cruel, however the <em>bhaktas</em> are so obsessed with their love for <em>Bhagavan</em> and they do not realize the aggressive nature of their <em>bhakti</em>. Like this, according to their inherent nature each one expresses their <em>bhakti</em> accordingly. There is nothing wrong in any type of worship and rituals, however, a wise person will only prefer a higher form of <em>bhakti</em>. People with rajasika and tamasika nature take time to understand the true nature of <em>Bhagavan</em>. Mostly people with <em>rajasika</em> and <em>tamasika</em> nature worship <em>Bhagavan</em> for material comforts, whereas, people with <em>sattvika</em> nature, if their <em>bhakti</em> is pure they will pass on to the next stage to <em>nishkama bhakti</em> with ease. Even if it is for the simple reason of attaining the worldly objects, if their <em>bhakti</em> is of the pure nature, it purifies the mind in which the higher principle is grasped. In the advanced stages of <em>sakama satvika bhakti</em> ( <em>bhakti</em> with desires) they train the mind to attain <em>Bhagavan</em>. Their bhakti transforms the weakness in their gunas and helps them to attain <em>Bhagavan</em>. This is called <em>guna parivarthana</em>. The invocation mantra of the Mundaka Upanisad is a <em>guna</em> <em>parivarthana mantra</em>, where one worships God for <em>guna parivarthana</em> to grasp the Truth. The mantra goes like this, &#8220;O Gods, may we hear only good things with our ears. O Gods, may we see only good things with our eyes. May we praise You with our body and all our organs steady. And may we live this life as long as the Gods decree. Peace for all&#8221;. People who have <em>nishkama</em> <em>bhakti</em> express their <em>bhakti</em> in the most humble and <em>sattvic </em>form.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><em>Vairagyam</em></strong><strong> (discrimination) and <em>ishvara jnanam</em> (knowledge of Baghavan)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In worldly life, when we meet a person for the first time, probably we will not experience any feeling. When we come to know more of that person we develop a feeling towards him. The same principle is used here. When we understand the nature of <em>Bhagavan</em> we automatically develop a feeling towards <em>Bhagavan</em>. The nature of <em>Bhagavan</em> does not change at all, only our understanding about Him increases slowly with <em>bhakti</em>. At present, we have knowledge about the worldly objects. Moreover, our feeling towards the worldly object changes constantly. Human mind cannot stick to any one object for a long time. At one stage of life, some objects give happiness to us. At another stage of life the same object is of least importance to us. For example, in our childhood stage dolls use to fancy us, but the feeling towards dolls is not the same in our adulthood. Likewise, an object that seems to be important to one person may be hated by another person. Therefore, the love for worldly objects changes with different persons and also at different stages. At one stage, we overcome the love for worldly objects and become obsessed with divine love. This leads to <em>nishkama bhakti</em>. We will feel that the affinity to <em>Bhagavan</em> by thoughts is more peaceful than the affinity towards objects. Desire is a mere illusion and is based on the mentality of a person. When <em>bhakti</em> intensifies a <em>bhakta</em> will realize that no objects can satisfy his desire other than the presence of <em>Bhagavan</em>. He develops <em>vairagya</em> (discrimination) towards objects. This is the juncture where <em>guna parivarthanam</em> happens in a person. Now the <em>bhakta&#8217;s sadhana</em> (practice) becomes the <em>sadhyam</em> (goal). Till then, his mind will be fluctuating between <em>Bhagavan</em> and worldly objects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There are two types of causes (<em>karanam</em>). They are <em>nimitta karanam</em> and <em>upadana karanam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Nimitta karanam</em> &#8211; In <em>Nimitta karanam,</em> there is an agent in between the cause and the effect. For example, for the material gold to become ornaments, the work of the goldsmith is inevitable. Here the goldsmith is the agent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Upadana karanam</em> &#8211; In <em>Upadana karanam,</em> the cause becomes the effect without an agent. For example, the spider builds its web by itself. It does not need any external material or help to build its web.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The universe is formed by the <em>upadana karanam</em>. The Consciousness uses its own power called <em>maya</em> to bring out this universe. Consciousness (<em>Bhagavan</em>) is manifested as the universe. This world is not separate from <em>Bhagavan</em>. He has become all. He does not have any name (<em>anami</em>) and any form (<em>arupi</em>). Only his manifestation has name and form for the sake of diversity. A wise person is not aware of the diversity and always aware of the underlying unity. He may be engaged in worldly activities but he is aware of his non-dual nature. He works for the sake of work and not for any personal gains. <em>Vairagyam</em> (discrimination) and <em>ishvara jnanam</em> (knowledge about <em>Bhagavan</em>) leads one to <em>nishkama bhakti</em> (desireless <em>bhakti</em>). A <em>nishkama</em> <em>bhakta</em> is a <em>karma</em> yogi. His mind is deeply rooted in the highest principle; still he works like an ordinary person. Success and failure do not bother him. He identifies himself with the highest principle and he becomes a <em>jnana</em> yogi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Rituals and feelings</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Bhakti</em> is mostly involved with rituals like pooja, sacred offerings etc. One performs a <em>pooja</em> with rituals and some <em>pooja</em> materials like flowers, incense sticks, some vessels etc. If <em>bhakti</em> is a feeling, then what is the need for rituals? If it is a ritual, then what is the importance of the feeling in <em>bhakti</em>? The answers to both the questions are, feeling and rituals -both lead to <em>bhakti</em>. If one has a divine feeling, he must express it; else that feeling will fade away. It is recommended to practice <em>bhakti</em> with rituals else the feeling of <em>bhakti</em> will fade away at initial stages. When <em>bhakti</em> intensifies there is no need for rituals. At one stage, <em>bhakta</em> will feel that rituals are a distraction for his <em>bhakti</em>. He feels that it is so artificial to offer <em>pooja</em> to his Self. At this stage he has reached the stage of <em>nishkama bhakti</em>. Till then rituals are needed to support his feelings. A <em>bhakta</em> should not ignore the rituals for the sake of lack of time or due to laziness. Under such circumstances the <em>bhakti</em> will get stagnated. If a <em>bhakta</em> does not believe in a particular type of ritual, he can opt for another type of ritual. However, rituals definitely enhance the feeling of <em>bhakti</em>. At the sametime, rituals performed without any deep feeling will not enhance the feeling of <em>bhakti</em>. Therefore, rituals are important to enhance the feeling of <em>bhakti</em> provided it is done with concentration and a deep feeling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><em>Saranagathi tattva</em></strong><strong> (total surrender)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Saranagathi tattva</em> is an important concept in <em>bhakti</em> yoga. One needs tremendous energy to run life smoothly in spite of the difficulties and obstacles in life. Even to forgive others we need energy. The mind will be continuously distracting us from our goal. We need energy to direct the mind towards the goal. A <em>bhakta</em> when he totally surrenders his everything to <em>Bhagavan</em>, he is relieved from his worries and he gains energy from <em>Bhagavan</em> to run his life smoothly. <em>Bhagavan</em> is the highest principle and when we connect with Him, His energy flows to us. As explained before, one should give love to receive love in return. One should also be able to recognize the love one receives in various forms. Only then he can be a content and happy person. When a <em>bhakta</em> gives unconditional love towards <em>Bhagavan</em>, he receives that love in return in various forms. This makes the <em>nishkama bhakta</em> a content and happy person. Human emotions take different forms to receive love from different relationships as father, mother, child, brother, boss, lover, teacher and so on. A <em>bhakta</em> assumes <em>Bhagavan</em> in one of these relations and he receives love in that form of relationship. Each relationship is important to us in each stage of life. At the infant stage parents are important to a person. At the childhood, parents and friends are important. At the adulthood, teacher is also important and like this at different stages each relationship becomes more important. If the <em>bhakta</em> misses any one relationship in that stage, he assumes <em>Bhagavan</em> as that relation and enjoys the feeling of that relationship with <em>Bhagavan</em> in that form. <em>Bhakti</em> fills his relationship. He opens his mind to <em>Baghavan</em> in that form of relationship. He will be relieved of his worries and sometimes receives answers for his problems also. Such pure love makes the mind matured for the next stage of <em>bhakti</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><em>Bhakti</em></strong><strong> comforts in different forms</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Bhakti</em> gives mental strength and <em>jnana</em>. At some phase of our life all must have faced some trying situations and difficulties. Those thoughts continuously haunt us and retard our progress in life. These negative thoughts will result in loss of intelligence and make us a dull person or a revengeful person. Bhakti helps us to divert from the haunting thoughts. <em>Bhakti</em> helps us to fill ourselves with faith and love.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><em>Bhakti</em> makes us to follow the right act (<em>dharma</em>). The teachings of <em>Bhagavan</em> in the concerned form purify the mind. Any action will definitely give result. The result of the action done with <em>bhakti</em> is <em>puniya</em> (positive effect). The experiences in life are the result of the actions done in the past. Experiences are of two types &#8211; <em>praballah prarabhda</em> (their results cannot be changed) and <em>durbalah prarabhda</em> (results can be changed to an extent). Prior to any action, thought of that action arises in the mind. If that thought is encouraged then it will result in the action. If the thoughts are not encouraged then they will fade away. Due to our negative karmas sometimes negative thoughts arise in the mind. Immediately, if they are counteracted by positive thoughts of <em>bhakti</em>, it will not lead to negative action. Suppose they are not counteracted by positive thoughts, the negative thoughts will lead to negative action and one has to experience their consequences. <em>Bhakti</em> can dispel the negative actions in the thought state itself. This is how the <em>durbalah prarabhda</em> is dispelled. However at times, there will be no time between the thought and action or we will not be aware of the thought itself. Everything will happen before we could react. Situation will be out of our control. This is the result of <em>praballah prarabhdah</em>. In such situations, <em>bhakti</em> will help to have mental strength to face any situation. When we experience the result of our positive karmas (action), <em>bhakti</em> helps us to gain mental stability and makes us a humble person.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As said earlier, when <em>bhakti</em> intensifies <em>bhakta</em> realizes <em>Bhagavan</em> as the highest principle. He realizes that <em>Bhagavan</em> as the <em>upadhana karana</em> of this universe, which means that the entire universe is not different from <em>Bhagavan</em>. Now the <em>bhakta</em> attains the status of <em>Viswarupa</em> <em>Bhakta</em>. He visualizes <em>Bhagavan</em> in all beings. He finds no difference between the different forms. He does not encourage enmity with anyone. Mind matures by his <em>Viswarupa bhakti</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><em>Nirguna Brahma bhakta</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The mind matures at each step. Now the <em>bhakta</em> realizes that <em>Bhagavan</em> is his Innerself, Atma. He does Atma <em>vichara</em> and attains <em>advaita jnana</em>, which is called <em>para bhakti</em>. He does not find difference between <em>Bhagavan</em> and himself. Duality induces fear of some kind or other towards <em>Bhagavan</em> like <em>Bhagavan</em> punishing the <em>bhakta</em>, expecting <em>Bhagavan</em> to take revenge on the <em>bhakta&#8217;s</em> enemies etc. These are all <em>bhakti</em> of the lower level. When the <em>bhakta</em> realizes the non-dual nature of <em>Bhagavan</em> he becomes an <em>advaiti</em> and he attains <em>videha mukti</em> (liberation in his life time itself). Thus <em>bhakti</em> yoga leads to the goal. <em>Bhakti</em> yoga is path towards the goal as well as the goal itself. It all depends on how one view <em>Bhagavan</em>.</p>

<p>We are waves of the same ocean</p>
<p>When we rise, we differ</p>

<p>I decided to differ, by accepting a form</p>
<p>If not, who identifies me</p>
<p>Nor you or I differ,</p>
<p>But we chose to differ</p>
<p>Many more like you and I,</p>
