<h4>                                                                                   LANGUAGE</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">What is a language?  A language is a combination of different sound vibrations, to make our thoughts clear to others.  Whenever a thought arises in the mind, a word accompanies it.  An alphabet is a sound vibration.  When the sound vibrations are combined, it becomes a word and it expresses our thought.  Different languages are the result of the different combinations of sound, used to express a same thought.  Basically, all languages are the different combinations of sound Vibrations.  Grammar explains the rules and regulations to combine different words to form a sentence; it is very important in a language.  It is the grammar, which makes a language efficient and complete.  If the grammar is not well crafted, then the thoughts cannot be expressed clearly.  Majority of the people think in their mother tongue, but there are exceptions too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Thoughts and mentality of the people of one region differ from the other region.  Depending on the thoughts and mentality of the region, a language is formed.  Therefore, each region has their unique language.  Some thoughts expressed in one language, cannot be expressed in another language.  For example, the word Atma in sanskrit, cannot be expressed exactly with the same meaning in any other language, because the thought of Atma exists only in India.  People of other countries have a little access to this idea.  This shows that a language is formed according to the thoughts and ideas common to the people of that region.  Some languages cannot expand beyond a limit, because the vocabulary of some languages is limited.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The ancient Indian language Sanskrit, is vast, deep, flexible with perfect grammar.  The sound vibrations of this language are deep and very powerful.  The grammar of this language is formed by Muni Panini. He was a great seer and a Maharshi.  It is said that Sanskrit language is in use for more than 5000 years.  All the ancient Indian scriptures are written in this language.  This language does not have a precedent language.  Most of the Indian languages are derived from the Sanskrit language.  Thoughts and feelings are expressed in an absolute and powerful way by using this language.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When many people follow a language, it becomes popular.  A wide range of people understands our feelings and thoughts, when they are expressed in a popular language.  A typical example of this is the English language.  It is a sleek and simple language.  It had its origin from the combination of two languages, Greek and Latin.  Fluency in a popular language gives us the freedom of expression.  In my view, no language is superior or inferior to any other language, because a language is only a combination of sound vibrations.  What matters is the thought.  If the thoughts are powerful, it will find its own way out.  It can be expressed in any language.  An example for this is the scared book, Sri Bhagavad Gita.  It was originally written in Sanskrit, but the powerful thoughts revealed by Lord Krishna, breaks the barrier of the language.  The power of the thoughts, will find its own way out.  If the thoughts are correct and powerful, then it will be definitely accepted by all, regardless of language.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify">                                                                            RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">There exists a wide disparity between religion and spirituality.  Religion is concrete and focused, whereas, spirituality is abstract.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Religion is based on emotions and beliefs.  It is based on the principle of devotion, to a personal God.  Infinite non-dual consciousness is assumed with attributes, name, and form.  According to our own belief and circumstances, we become a part of a cult.  We follow the rituals of that particular cult, in which we are trained.  People following a particular belief and their rituals unite and that group grows to become a religion.  People take forward that religion, based on the sacred books written by the initial followers of that religion.  It spreads wide and many people with the same mentality accept that religion.  In my view, that one supreme power is worshipped with different beliefs and rituals.  The rituals and beliefs differ according to the nature of a person.  Many factors influence a person.  His nature and beliefs are affected by such influences.  When we worship God with prayers, we assume God as separate and supreme to us.  We assume the personal God according to our mentality, we offer prayers and express our wishes, and we expect a reply from God.  We become truly devoted to Him.  When devotion reaches a peak level, spirituality slowly emerges.  At this point, we understand the true nature of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When we become more and more devoted to God, we understand more, and we realize the nature of God.  We slowly start to think that, how can a supreme power differ, for different people?  Spirituality is, viewing God as one supreme power, which is the source of all and That power is present in all beings.   When we become spiritual, we will be more composed and we will understand many hidden facts.  A person will become more matured, to follow the principles of that one creator &#8211; peace and contentment.  Spirituality makes the mind to focus on the impersonal God.  Spirituality makes a person to realize that, divinity is present in all beings, but it manifests only in a few people.  When divinity manifests, differences vanish.  When differences vanish, peace emerges out.  In spirituality, we strive to understand ourselves through meditation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Depending on the knowledge of God, a person can become religious or spiritual.  There are infinite ways to understand that infinite being.  All the views and ideas about God are correct, but what makes the difference is, how far we are able to realize Him in the absolute sense.  Even though, our ideas and views are correct, there will be always a gap between our understanding and the reality.  This gap makes the difference.  Fighting and criticizing about different beliefs, expose our immaturity.  A person&#8217;s life will be complete, only when he absolutely knows the unknown.</p>

<h4>                                                             MEDITATION AND ITS EFFECTS</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Meditation was practiced by the Rishis of the Vedic period, since then meditation is being practiced in India.  Meditation is a skill, and it has to be developed gradually.  In India meditation is Known as Dhyana, and it is very powerful.  Sadguru Jaggi Vasudev says that, &#8216; We can never do meditation, but we can become meditative.  When we bring our body, mind, and energy to a certain level of preparedness, then meditation will happen&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is a Vedic tradition and in ancient India, only sages and Rishis practiced meditation.  The Rishis discovered that the body and mind are focused outwards.  They practiced meditation to discover their true inner self.  They succeeded in it and they passed on their teachings to the future generations through the scriptures and their students.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the modern world, people from all lifestyles practice meditation.  Some professions make meditation as a compulsory practice.  People ranging from acetic to beauty pageants practice meditation, and they have their own purpose for practicing it.  The problem with popularization is that, the original method of meditation is diluted to suit different people, and many forget the spiritual origin of meditation.  Meditation is a very subtle divine process and it should be practiced with care.  There are different techniques to practice meditation.  All the techniques are equally powerful.  The type and technique of meditation is selected according to the mentality of the person.  A few types of meditation and its techniques are given below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1. Meditation for spiritual and emotional growth of a person</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2. Devotional meditation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">3. Advanced meditation (based on Advaita philosophy).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> PREPARATION FOR MEDITATION</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The first step for meditation is to prepare the body and mind.  Whenever we sit for meditation, the mind wanders; it is due to the lack of preparation.  If the mind is under tension, anxiety, fear, or worry, then the mind will not settle down easily.  Body must cooperate with the mind to remain calm, and the mind must be calm for the body to remain without moving.  The sitting posture for meditation is very important.  The body should be erect, the muscles must be relaxed, the eyes should be barely closed and unfocused, the head should be strait, and the chest portion must be stretched out.  Sitting on cushions and leaning on some objects are not recommended.  When the body is prepared, the next step is to prepare the mind.  There is deep connection between the body and the mind.  Understanding this connection, Maharshi Patanjali suggests Pranayama to calm the mind and body (it is advisable to learn pranayama from a well-trained Guru).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When our mind is active, we always experience fast breath.  When the mind is relaxed, we experience slow breath.  Mind affects the breath and breath affects the mind.  When we breathe slowly, the mind and the body will be relaxed, but in a few minutes, we will be snoring and not meditating, because slow breath induces sleep.  Slow breath calms the mind, but it induces sleep.  Something must be done along with the slow breath, so that it will not induce sleep, and that technique is pranayama. When we increase the lung pressure, a lot of air comes into our body, the blood will be oxygenated, and the person will not feel drowsiness.  For this, we have to inhale and exhale slowly (in terms of speed) and strongly (pumping in and out a lot of air). Inhaling and exhaling pressure should be neither too low nor too high.  This pranayama makes the mind calm without causing drowsiness.  This basic preparation of the mind and body helps meditation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">TYPES AND TECHNIQUES OF MEDITATION</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1. MEDITATION FOR SPIRITUAL GROWTH OF A PERSON</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">SIT STRAIGHT IN A COMFORTABLE POSTURE, RELAX THE BODY, CLOSE THE EYES, KEEP IT UNFOCUSED. TRY TO REMAIN IN A THOUGHTLESS STATE.  WHEN THOUGHTS APPEAR IGNORE IT, REMAIN FOR A FEW MINUTES (ATLEAST 15 MINUTES), THEN BRING BACK THE CONCENTRATION TO THE BODY AND GENTLY OPEN THE EYES.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Peace is our inherent nature, but we fail to recognise it.  We are unable to feel our inherent nature because the mind is clouded with thoughts.  When our mind is calm, we feel contented and we realise our inherent nature.  In the beginning stages of meditation, it is impossible to remove all the thoughts.  When the thoughts are fewer, still we can realise peace.  For example, when there are a lot of ripples in the pond, we are unable to see the bottom of the pond.  When there are fewer ripples, still we can see the bottom, though not very clearly.  There is no need to panic by the appearance of thoughts.  Allow the thoughts to pass on the screen of the mind.  When the thoughts are not responded, peace and silence will be uninterrupted, even in the presence of  thoughts.  Gradually, the thoughts will disappear.  When the thoughts are restricted, the mind will be under strain and the thoughts will bounce back strongly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Another technique advised by the Rishis is to practice an optional thought.  When we find difficult to ignore the thoughts, we can strongly think about a positive elevating thought.  It is called an optional thought.  It can be a mantra or an elevating thought like &#8216;I am a blissful soul&#8217;, or &#8216;I am sat chit ananda swarupam&#8217;, etc. the optional thought must be a spiritual thought.  We can consciously think about an optional thought, so that the other thoughts will fade off.  In the initial stages, the optional thought will be prominent, by practice, even the optional thought will fade away and the thoughtless state will remain.  Practice makes the mind calm and active, and then meditation happens.  Mind will not move outwards.  This will happen gradually and significantly.  The nature of the mind is fickle.  Whenever the mind wanders, the mind should be brought back to the optional thought.  Try to ignore the other thoughts.  Lord krishna tells Ajuna that, &#8220;Undoubtedly, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the mind is difficult to control and restless; but by practice and by dispassion it may be restrained&#8221; BH.GITA 6, 35.  In the initial stages, to remain in the meditative state for a few minutes itself is a great progress.  A short focused meditation is much more beneficial than a long unfocused meditation.  Trying to meditate for half an hour is regarded as a standard practice.  Even a few minutes of meditation brings a lot of progress spiritually and emotionally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2. DEVOTIONAL MEDITATION</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">SIT STRAIGHT IN A COMFORTABLE POSTURE, RELAX THE MUSCLES, AND CLOSE THE EYES AND TRY TO MEDITATE ON THE FORM OF BHAGAVAN (GOD) FROM HEAD TO TOE.  FEEL THAT THE GAZE OF THE BHAGAVAN IS ON OUR MIND.  MENTALLY FEEL HIS PRESENCE.  REMAIN SILENT FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND THEN GENTLY OPEN THE EYES.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Devotional meditation is suitable for bhakti culture (devotion), where a personal God (bhagavan) is worshiped.  Infinite consciousness is imagined with attributes, name, and form.  Meditating a form is more concrete than the abstract meditation.  In Hindu philosophy, there is freedom to assume Bhagavan as the supreme Lord or as a close relative or as a friend or as a master; it all depends on the mentality of the devotee.  Devotional meditation suits the emotional people and their emotions are made calm by this meditation.  Devotional meditation is Dvaitam (dualism), where God is imagined as different and supreme to the devotee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is a common type of meditation, because most of the people are emotionally imbalanced.  The most common problem in life is, we hold on to some feelings or emotions, and we assume that our life will not move without experiencing them.  When we become more attached, we are very dependent on it.  We are so much attached and dependent on certain matters in life, such that we are unable to search for options.  This causes a lot of suffering.  Mind is the source of suffering and meditation is focused on the mind.  Very often, we try to control things, which are not under our control.  Universe works under the laws of nature, on which we have no control.  Sometimes we may be forced to accept situations, which may not be comfortable to us.  Nature changes according to time and its effects on us are inevitable.  Lord Krishna says, &#8220;Beings are unmanifested in the beginning, manifested in the middle state, O Ajuna, and unmanifested again in their end.  What is there to grieve about?&#8221;BH.GITA 2, 28.  Mind is like a mirror, if the reflecting medium is dirty, then the reflection becomes distorted.  The world is as it is, but the mind is coated with desires, likes, and dislikes.  The basic impurity is the ignorance.  We watch the world and the self through the mind.  A person with low self-esteem watches himself through the ignorance of his mind.  Each unfavorable experience leaves an impression on the mind and it is an impurity and a burden.  When the impurities stack up, we become emotionally weak.  The mind should give accurate reflection; else, our perspective towards the world is affected.  It is a natural tendency for any person to focus on problems.  We are scared of the future.  The negative tendency in a person should be erased, and the positive attitude should be practiced.  When we turn the mind to Bhagavan, the negative attitude of the mind changes, and the impurities of the mind lose their strength.  This shifts the perspective and understanding of life.  In devotional meditation we always feel the presence of Bhagavan.  An emotional minded person can always share their emotions with Bhagavan.  Problems and failures in life are created by the Karmas (actions).  If the devotee feels that Bhagavan is responsible for the problems, then this meditation will not comfort him, because the devotee will become more emotional while meditating.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In devotional meditation, we have to imagine the full form of the personal God, from head to toe.  The full form of Bhagavan now appears in the mind.  Focus the mind on his face.  Try to imagine his face part by part, and finally focus the attention on his eyes.  His loving gaze directly goes into our mind.  Now we are close to Bhagavan, loving gaze of Bhagavan goes inside us.  This is the perfect Dharshan.  You are seeing Bhagavan and you are also seen by Bhagavan.  There is no need for a prayer or no need to tell our problems.  In that silent moment, Bhagavan understands our problems.  This is a typical moment; we are with God.  We are seen, known, blessed by Him in such moments.  Remain for a few minute.  Slowly shift the attention to his toes, and then gently open the eyes.  The mind will be relieved of all the worries and will be relaxed by this meditation.  This meditation gives emotional stability, security, contentment, and a feeling of comfort by the presence of Bhagavan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">3. ADVANCED MEDITATION(based on Advaita philosophy).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">SIT STRAIGHT IN A COMFORTABLE POSTURE, RELAX THE BODY, CLOSE THE EYES, KEEP IT UNFOCUSED. TRY TO REMAIN IN THOUGHTLESS STATE.  IN THAT THOUGHTLESS STATE, YOU EXIST AS CONSCIOUSNESS; YOU ABIDE AS BRAHMAN.  FEEL THAT, &#8216; I AM BRAHMAN, THE SUPREME NON-DUAL CONSCIOUSNESS&#8217;, REMAIN IN THAT STATE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE.  SLOWLY SHIFT CONCENTRATION TO THE BODY.  GENTLY OPEN THE EYES.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This is a very powerful meditation.  Advaita vedanta declares hard truths, and we understand them a little by little, because our grasping power will increase only gradually, by a lot of listening, reasoning, and meditation.  In this meditation, the thoughtless state is observed deeply.  As the first step, the mind should be disciplined.  Mind should be occupied by something, so that it can be restrained from wandering.  A mantra is a powerful tool for the mind to concentrate.  Mantra can restrict the mind to an extent.  Even while chanting a mantra, mind will have the tendency to wander.  Continuous practice will restrain the mind from wandering.  Meditation is a skill and only repeated practice makes it perfect.  It is just like a child learning to walk.  Whenever the child falls while learning to walk, it should get up and walk again.  Similarly, whenever the mind wanders, it must be brought back to repeat the mantra.  Each mantra has its own power and it will help to calm the mind, and remain in the meditative state.  We know only the partial nature of the consciousness.  The mind should be active and silent to understand consciousness.  The true nature of a person is pure consciousness and bliss, but unfortunately, we experience only the thoughts, emotions, and feelings.  The mind is superimposed on pure consciousness.  Consciousness is omnipresent, but the mind covers the consciousness.  In the absence of thoughts, consciousness is revealed.  There is an unchanging consciousness behind the constantly changing experiences.  In the presence of thoughts, the observer is not observed.  In deep sleep, thoughts are not present, but the mind is also not active; so the observer cannot be observed.  In the waking state, the mind is active, but the consciousness is covered by the thoughts.  We can experience consciousness in-between the two thoughts.  For example, in a string of pearls, the pearls cover the string, which holds them.  When two pearls are moved apart, the string is seen.  Similarly, at the end of a thought, and before the beginning of the next thought, there exists a small gap.  In this gap, there will be no thoughts, emotions, or feelings, and consciousness is present as the observer and not as the observed.  When the thoughts are associated, then the gap is not clear.  When the thoughts are identical, then the gap is clear.  Mantras are used as identical thoughts.  The gap in-between the repetition of the mantra reveals the consciousness.  Gradually, the repetition speed of the mantras should be decreased; by this, the gap between the repetitions of the mantra is increased.  The mind will have the tendency to wander in the gap; care should be taken to divert the mind towards the mantra.  When we gain practice, the mantras can be dropped and we can remain in the state of non-dual, conscious state.  In the thoughtless state, we abide as Brahman.  Then the meaning of the mahavakyas,&#8221; Aham Brahma Asmi&#8221;, meaning, &#8216;I am Brahman&#8217; is realised.  This advanced state of meditation makes a person realise that, &#8216; I am Brahman (pure consciousness) with experience, by removing the experiences, I remain as Brahman alone&#8217;.  This is a profound philosophy, very different from the other philosophies.  A moment of silence is an experience, from which we can learn a lot.  Lord Krishna tells in Bhagavad Gita that &#8220;Shradhavan labhathe jhanam&#8221; meaning, a person with faith can gain knowledge.  Each individual is infinite pure consciousness, but due to ignorance, we are not aware of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">EFFECTS OF MEDITATION ON THE BODY</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1. Meditation helps to maintain the body hormone levels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2. Cortisol is a stress hormone.  High levels of cortisol in the blood lead to cardio vascular disease.  When cortisol level goes up, a person manifests the symptom of stress like fatigue, lack of sleep, sudden weight lose, and depression.  Meditation lowers the cortisol in the blood.  This reduces stress and allows thinking clearly.  Cortisol is not a harmful hormone, but when it is produced in excess, it kills and injures brain cells in billions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">3. Melatonin is a hormone, which is responsible for maintaining the biological clock of the human body.  Low level of melatonin in blood results in insomnia, and other sleeping disorders.  Meditation helps to increase the level of melatonin in blood.  It relaxes the body and we get more sleep.  Melatonin, produced by the pineal gland in the brain is important in the regulation of many hormones in the body.  Melatonin helps to stimulate cells called osteoblasts, which promotes bone growth.  Melatonin acts as a powerful antioxidant, destroying harmful free radicals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">4. Serotonin is a hormone, which controls the behaviour and influence the mood of a person.  Low level of serotonin leads to depression, migraine, and insomnia.  Meditation regulates the level of serotonin in the body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">5. Dr. Herbert Benson, a professor at the Harvard Medical School studied on &#8216;the relaxation response&#8217; in the state of meditation.  He observed that while meditating, a person&#8217;s blood flow is directed towards the parasympathetic nervous system.  This part of the brain triggers rest and relaxation &#8211; the opposite of sympathetic nervous system (fight flight response).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When blood goes to parasympathetic system the heart rate and breathing will slow down, blood vessels will be dilated and the blood flow increases and relaxes the muscles.  Research by Dr. Benson also showed a raise in the level of nitric oxide produced during meditation.  It dilates the arteries and increases blood flow throughout the body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">6. The research conducted by the division of cardiology at the Cedars &#8211; Sinai medical center shows that a mantra based meditation method lower the blood pressure, and improve the insulin resistance and lower the heart rate variability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">7. Regular meditation increases DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) which helps our immune system.  It fights against bacteria, parasitic and viral infections.  A high level of DHEA steriod hormones in the blood protects us from problems caused due to ageing.  Meditation helps to improve DHEA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">8. When we are in stress, the level of endorphin&#8217;s (feel good hormones) in blood goes down.  Endorphin is responsible for the immune system.  Meditation increases the level of endorphin and helps our body&#8217;s defense system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">9. The adrenal glands situated above the kidney, produces hormones called noradrenalin and adrenaline.  Noradrenalin is associated with aggression, fighting behaviour, alertness and creates a feeling of arousal.  Adrenaline is associated with anxiety.  Adrenal glands also produce cortisol.  Low level of these hormones prevents gastric ulcer.  Meditation helps to lower the level of these hormones in blood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">10. Meditation controls the electric impulse from the brain.  Electric impulse reduces the resistance power of the skin.  By meditation, the electrical impulse decreases and the resistance power increases.  Decrease in the electrical impulse increases the positive attitude.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">These are some of the effect of meditation on body.  Meditation is a very powerful subtle process, and it helps the body and mind.  &#8220;When all the senses are stilled, when the mind is at rest, when the intellect wavers not &#8211;  then is known the highest state of Divinity.  He who attains it is free from delusion.&#8221;  Katha Upanishad.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Consciousness is a mystery for a common person.  Ancient Sages and Rishis of India explored consciousness in deep meditation and they recorded their observations in the Upanisads and in other scriptures.    The Rishis wanted everyone to explore deep into it, to find the truth.  They called consciousness as &#8220;chaitanya&#8221;, because it illumines everything.  Chaitanya is an experience and it is not known in any other way.  Science and other philosophies ignored consciousness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Knowledge must include the &#8216;knower'(subject), beyond the &#8216;known'(object).  Science explains the known, Upanishad explains the knower.  Without the knower, the knowledge is incomplete.  Knowledge about the knower, is not a superstition, in fact it is the real science.  The known is always changing and there is only one truth, which is unchangeable, and that is the knower, the pure consciousness.  According to Mundaka Upanishad, there are two types of knowledge.  They are</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1.Para vidya</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2. Apara vidya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Para vidya, is the external knowledge, which means knowledge about which the five senses come into contact.  This is called the object knowledge.  Science, technology, literature etc. are some of the examples of this knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Apara vidya, is the research done internally.  The chaitanya knows about itself and also about its manifestations.  This is called the subject knowledge.  Brahma vidya(science of the consciousness) is the subject knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Upanisad says that, man is not a mere body.  He is Sat-Chit-Ananda swarupa, meaning truth-consciousness-bliss.  The aim of the Upanishad is to make a person realise that the self in him is non-dual infinite consciousness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Science is concerned with the body and brain; Spirituality is concerned with mind and its source.  According to spirituality, the source of every object is infinite.  There is an unknown factor behind every known object, which unfortunately science cannot explain.  The unknown factor can be realised by Advaita philosophy, it can only be realised and cannot be exhibited.  Science needs visual proofs.  Consciousness(Brahman) is beyond the five senses and the results can be experienced after a very long journey.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">A person does not know an object, until the consciousness illumines the mind.  A thought becomes active, only when consciousness is drawn to it, else, the thought will not have any value.  Consciousness manifests itself, and it is independent.  Creation is dependent on consciousness else, creation will not exist.  Beyond this chaotic system, there is a serene source called consciousness.  Consciousness is not an object; It is the subject.  Existing in the subject, we have to analyse the subject.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is very difficult to give a scientific explanation for consciousness, because without knowing his own self, the researcher cannot complete his research.  Different manifestations are different levels of consciousness.  In Hindu philosophy, Bhagavan Shiv is the highest level of consciousness(various religions have their own  highest level of consciousness).  Mountains and stones are the lowest level of consciousness.  &#8220;The all pervading consciousness, Brahman interpenetrates everything living and non-living&#8221;(Chandogya Upanisad).  If the consciousness manifests completely, then the person is a divine person (God).  If consciousness manifests partially, then he is a normal person.  If consciousness is dormant, then it is a matter alone (example stone).  Swami Vivekananda said, &#8216;Mind at a very low rate of vibration is what is known as matter.  Matter at a high rate of vibration is known as mind.  Both matter and mind is the same substance&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mental states are the different kinds of vibrations that emanate from consciousness.  Some mental states vibrate in a calm and serene mode.  They reflect consciousness in the pure form.  Most of the mental states are agitated, and they reflect consciousness according to the mind.  A pure mind will portray consciousness in a pure form.  The manner, in which the consciousness emerges from an object, cannot be exhibited scientifically.  Science can be realised by the five senses, whereas Consciousness is non-divisible, non-dual, and infinite.  Consciousness cannot be measured, whereas, science needs exact measurements.  Science can only understand the outward manifestation of consciousness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The role of the observer, his nature, and his observations are very important to complete the research, which science or quantum theory cannot explain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The uncertainty principle of Werner Heisenberg states that,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1. Sub-atomic particles, in the ultimate analysis, can never be known with perfect precision.  Heisenberg determined that our observations have an effect on the behavior of quanta</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2. Strict causality is impossible in sub-atomic world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">3. Purely objective description of reality is not possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The reason stated above forced the quantum physicist to create thought experiments based on the observations from real experiments conducted at the quantum level.  Scientist feels that &#8220;there is a limit to how well we can ever really understand the universe&#8221;.  World is not complete without the observer, though the observer is unattached to the happenings of the world.  When a matter is explained, the influence of the observer on the matter also is to be explained, else the explanation is incomplete.  This incompleteness is reflected in the different fields of science.  For example, with all due respect for the remarkable achievements in the medical field, I would like to point out that, medical science is unable to cure all.  Medicine and treatment works depending on the mentality of the patient.  Self-confidence, which is the reflection of the consciousness, works along with medicines.  Mostly, along with the medicines and treatment, a disease is cured depending on the mentality of the patient and the doctor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Consciousness is complete, fully content, and infinite.  Then, what could be the reason for this manifestation?  Sri Gaudapada says &#8216;there cannot be any other reason, other than; it is the very nature or essence of Brahman&#8217;.  If Brahman exists, then manifestation will also exist.  If Brahman decides, it will retreat the manifestation and make it dormant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Science takes a diversion outside, and philosophy takes a diversion inside.  However, some factors are common both for science and for philosophy.  Science explains the creation in its own terms as atoms, protons, neutrons etc.  Similarly, philosophy explains the creation as prakriti, purusha, ahamkara, mahat tattwa, and their twenty-four evolutes as best explained by sankhya philosophy.  Philosophy will never explain about the atoms, nuclear reactors, spacecrafts or the other comforts of the material world, because the aim of the philosophy is to understand and explain the very existence.  If the basics are not clear, there will be flaw in further research.  Philosophy aims at the fundamental concepts of the material world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">A person who experiences consciousness cannot exhibit it before anyone.  A Rishi will be &#8220;content with  what comes to him without effort, free from the pairs of opposite and envy, even minded in success and failure, though acting he is not bound&#8221;(Baghavad Gita,4,22).  We can understand that a person has realised Brahman from his behavior.  He transcends the three gunas(sattwa, Rajas, tamas) and establish his mind in that infinite consciousness.  The Rishis of India are of this nature.  They meditate and realise the truth, and they record their experiences in the form of slokas(couplets) and as poems.  They help others to understand about the unknown.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mind, in the form of thought activates the brain.  Mind is subtle and brain is physical.  Medical science explains the brain as an information processing system.  The brain is divided into the right and left cerebral hemispheres.  The cerebral cortex is divided into numerous sensory receiving areas and motor control areas.  A human brain contains approximately 100billion neurons.  All types of thoughts, emotions, and variety of impressions depend on the function of the neurons.  Neurons receive signals through dendrites, and send the information through axons.  Dendrites and axons are the extension of the neuron bodies.  The dendrites are highly branched and the axons are not branched.  Chemical transmitters called synapses mediate communication between different neurons.  Information moves along axons in the form of electrical impulses, known as action potentials.  The neurons connect with each other through the dendrites and axons, and this gives rise to various thoughts and memories.  A single thought connects many neurons.  Neuroscientists say that, the connection of the neurons gives rise to thoughts.  On what basis, are the neurons connected?  The neuroscientists say that, the connection of neurons is a direct neural correlate of awareness.  What causes the awareness to select those particular neurons to connect?  Philosophical answer to this is, &#8220;the mind&#8221;.  Mind is the storage of information, which stores the experiences as impressions.    The impressions, one after the other send waves to the surface of the mind, and creates ripples on the mind stuff.  The ripples activate similar mental impressions and within seconds, the whole mental layer is filled with similar thoughts waves.  Each thought is a vibration with a definite frequency.  The thought waves stimulate the brain, and the brain functions as explained above.  The mind has to be controlled, to control the activities of the brain.  The mind is based on consciousness.  Mind is the connection between the soul and the body. Thought waves from the mind directly affect the brain.  A human being is a mind and body complex, where the body and its related parts can be explained by science, whereas the mind its related part is explained by philosophy.  We view the world according to our mentality.  The mind expands by gathering information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In ancient times, there was a wide gap between science and philosophy<i>.</i>  Advaita philosophy remains the same as explained in the Upanishad.  Today, with the advancement of science in many ways, the gap seems to decrease.  Science feels that the universe is matter and energy.  Advaitam says that consciousness is inherent in the universe.  Science may find it difficult to accept this philosophy.  What philosophy says is, even though science is highly advanced and acceptable it has to borrow more from philosophy to understand the basic facts about the universe.  By the exploration of the quantum theory scientist try to understand philosophy through science.  Swami Vivekananda believed that, physics will accept the conclusions of   Advaita vedanta, but for this, the research in both physics and Advaita vedanta has to go deep into the grass root level.  The famous Indian scientist Sir J.C.Bose discovered that the same consciousness pulsates in man, plants, and even metals but in different ways.  Three decades after Sir J.C.Bose, Erwin schrodinger wrote, &#8216;how does the idea of plurality arise at all?&#8217;  Upanishad says that &#8220;sarvam khalvidam Brahma&#8221;, meaning everything in this universe is Brahman (consciousness).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In an altered state of consciousness, we experience the universal presence of the non-dual consciousness.  Only a human being can express consciousness in a better way.  &#8220;Creation is the appearance of name and form of the infinite Brahman, which is of the nature of absolute existence-consciousness-bliss, like foam on the surface of an ocean&#8221;( Drig Drishya Viveka).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Energy or force in the universe is derived from one cosmic energy( prana).  Prana is also a manifestation of Brahman(consciousness).  Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa compares Brahman -the absolute consciousness as a ripple less sea, and compares cosmic energy(shakti) with a ripple less sea creating typhoons.  Consciousness is called Siva and the cosmic energy is shakti.  Consciousness works through the ego, mind, and body.  Brihadaranyaka Upanisad says &#8220;one universal imperishable consciousness has penetrated everything in this universe&#8221; Br.Up 3,8,11</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Many scientists believe that mysticism is a weakness, but Albert Einstein believed that &#8216;It is the theory which decides, what can be observed&#8217;.  Einstein also said that &#8216;pure thought can grasp reality, as the ancients dreamt&#8217;.  Indian Rishis during meditation came face to face with reality.  They did not depend on anything external, yet they were able to understand the whole universe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Advaita philosophy states that, &#8216;you are not the part of the whole, you are the whole&#8217;.  Powerful statements like &#8220;Tat Twam Asi&#8221;, &#8220;Aham Brahma Asmi&#8221;, proves it.  Pure consciousness cannot be divided.  When I am that pure consciousness, then I have to be the whole.  I cannot be part of the whole, because consciousness is undivided.  The goal of Advaita vedanta is to realise this factor.  Swami Vivekananda said,&#8221;Religion is the manifestation of the divinity already in man.  Each soul is potentially divine.  The goal is to manifest the divinity within&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Great scientist like Niels Bohr, Prof.John A.Wheeler, Max Planck, Werner Heisenberg, and Edwin Schrodinger believed in philosophy, especially the vedanta philosophy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Swami Vivekananda says, &#8220;Religion is the science which learns the transcendental in nature through the transcendental in man.  We know little of man, consequently, little of the universe.  When we know more of man, we shall probably know more of the universe.  Man is the epitome of all things and all knowledge is in him&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mind is the cause of dualism.  When the mind vanishes, only consciousness remains.  Philosophy and Science cannot converge in dualism(dvaitam).  Only in Advaitam, philosophy and science can converge.  According to Advaitam, there is no attributes to the absolute.  Consciousness is a deep ocean, whereas science is a ship sailing on that ocean.  Science is external and limited; consciousness is infinite, non-dual, omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient.  Science emanates from consciousness; manifestations of the consciousness are intelligently explained by science.  Science and consciousness cannot be separated.  Until this fact is realised, arguments and misunderstandings will continue.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify"></h4>
<h4>                                                                    THE SEER AND THE SEEN</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">Advaita Vedanta is a profound spiritual study.  There are four Mahavakyas(statements) taken from different Upanisads, which are the essence of Advaitam.  One of them is &#8220;TAT TVAM ASI&#8221; meaning &#8220;You are That&#8221;.  This mahavakya from Chandogya Upanisad  conceptualises the whole of Advaita Philosophy in three words.  It implies that, the individual is not different from Brahman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Universe can be explained as the relationship between, the subject and the object.  In other words it is the relationship between the Purusha(spirit) and the Prakriti(matter).  In layman parlance, it can be explained as the relationship between an individual and the external objects.  In Advaita philosophy, this relationship is called as the &#8220;seer and the seen&#8221;.  It can also be called as the &#8220;observer and the observed&#8221;, the &#8220;perceiver and the perceived&#8221;, and so on.  This concept is the basic of Advaita vedanta.  When this concept is clear, it will be helpful to understand Advaitam to the core and this article is a humble effort to make this concept clear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Knowledge means, the knowledge of the observer, and the knowledge of the observed, world.  What we observe may be different, but the observer is one.  This concept is analysed extensively in the prestigious work of Sri Adi Shankara, &#8220;Drig Drishya Viveka&#8221;.  It is also explained in the thirteenth chapter of Bhagavad Gita.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Advaita philosophy is not a philosophy exclusively for the ascetics.  Its deep ideas and principles when followed, will help to ease the life of any common man.  The Rishis always find truths and facts, which are universally applicable and solve the problems of all, regardless of the caste, creed, gender, religion.  Advaita philosophy helps us to understand our life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Any person will view the world according to his own experiences.  Unfortunately, most of his experiences are misinterpreted.  Many a time, the belief of a person, will contradict with the reality.  An example for this is, we all have watched the sunset, but in fact, the sun never sets.  It is the rotation of the earth, which makes the sun appear as moving.  A person who is not aware of this scientific fact, misinterprets his experience.  Ignorance leads to misinterpretation.  Like this, most of the experiences in a person&#8217;s life are misinterpreted, which leads to confusion and problem.  A valuable life, which is meant to experience and enjoy, will pass on with pain and suffering.  Advaita philosophy helps a person to understand his experiences, in the correct manner.  This understanding will help a person to interact with the world in a better way.  The world remains the same, only our interaction with the world changes.  Knowledge destroys illusion and misinterpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Advaita philosophy believes that, the world is the manifestation of the non-dual infinite Brahman.  The world we view is Brahman, but, it is very difficult to accept this fact, without a deep and clear understanding of Advaita philosophy.  The concepts and theories of Advaita philosophy will help a person to understand and accept this fact.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Advaita philosophy is understood by the sruti(scriptures), yukti(reasoning) and anubhava(experience).  A person should analyse his own experiences to understand himself, and the world.  When a person analysis his experience, he will be able to find the fact, that the observer is always different from the observed.  This implies that, the experiencer is different from the experiences(anubhava).  Only Advaita philosophy has the boldness to say that, the experiences of a person are external.  Adi shankara has made this bold and complicated fact clear in his work &#8220;Drig Drishya Viveka&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The world looks different, because it is manifest with different forms and ideas.  We observe and experience the world with the five sense organs(eye, ear, nose, tongue, skin) in our body.  Here the most prominent sense organ, eye, is taken for explanation.  This is applicable to all other organs.  A single pair of eye observes the different forms.  The observer is the eye, and the observed is the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The organ eye also has its own qualities like blindness, dullness, sharpness etc.  The quality of the organ also merges with the image (for example, dull image).  The different qualities of the organ and the images of the external world is cognised by the mind, which is one.  In this context, the mind is the observer; organs and experiences of the world are the observed.  The mind, which is the observer, analyses the different observed images.  An example of the eyesight makes this point more clear.  The cornea in the eye takes widely diverging rays of light and bends them through the pupil.  The lens in the back of the pupil helps to focus light at the back of the eye, retina.  The nerve cells in the retina change the light rays into electrical impulses and pass them through the optic nerve to the brain, where an image is perceived.  Philosophy says, the image of the object perceived by the brain, becomes an impression on the mind.  We do not see the object directly.  We directly see the image of the object, in the mind.  We do not see the world, which is not in our mind.  A single mind perceives the variety of images.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The qualities of the mind, in the form of different desires, doubt, belief, and disbelief, firmness, fear etc. are revealed by non-dual consciousness.  There must be an observer to observe the different mental activities.  The observer is the consciousness and the observed is the mind.  Consciousness, which is the observer, does not have any qualities and there is no observer, to observe the consciousness.  The chain of observation stops with consciousness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">(Consciousness in philosophy is different from the medical term conscious.  Medical term &#8216;conscious&#8217; means, aware of the surrounding.  Philosophical consciousness has a deep meaning and the whole effort of Advaita vedanta is to understand that consciousness).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>&#8220;Rupam drishyam lochanam drig, tad drishyam drig tu manasam; drishya dhivrittayah sakshi, drig eva na tu drishyate&#8221;    </i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">                                                                                                                                                                             Drig drishya viveka(verse 1)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>&#8220;Form is observed, eye is the observer.  That(eye) is the observed, mind is the observer.  Mental activities are observed, witness is the observer.  But that observer is not observed&#8221;.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">A person may feel, that the experiences (thoughts and emotions) are his own.  Advaitam says that the experiences are external.  The nature and quality of the mind is explained in Verse 6 of Drig drishya viveka.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>&#8220;cicchaya veshato budau bhanam dhis tu dvidha sthita; ekahankritir anya syad antahkarana rupini&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>&#8220;Manifest in the mind, consciousness shines being reflected.  Mind is two-fold; one aspect is ahamkara(ego), the other is antahkarana(mind)&#8221;<br>
</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mind has two aspects &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1.     Ahamkara(ego)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2.     Antahkarana(mind)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Both ahamkara and antahkarana are vrittis(thoughts).  Ahamkara is the pure thought of &#8220;I&#8221;(aham).  Ego in advaitam is not pride; It is the basic identification of a person and it is a vritti(thought).  Ahamkara is not consciousness either.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Antahkarana(mind) is the experiences of a person.  In vedanta, the experiences are called reflected consciousness.  The experiences in the form of impressions are insentient, until they are illumined by consciousness.  This fact can be explained by the two important theories of  Advaita philosophy.  They are</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1.   Pratibhimba vada(reflection theory)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2.   Avaccheda vada(limitation theory)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Pratibhimba vada is explained by an example.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When sunlight falls on a bucket filled with water, the water reflects the sunlight.  The reflection depends on the purity and the ripples present in the water.  If there are ripples in the water, then the reflection will not be perfect.  In the same sense, the sunlight is compared to the consciousness, the bucket is compared to the body, and the water is compared to the mind.  Consciousness illumines the mind, and the mind reflects consciousness.  This is called &#8220;reflected consciousness &#8220;.  The ripples (thoughts) present in the mind affect the reflection of the consciousness by the mind.  This is called the reflection theory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Avaccheda vada is explained by an example.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Space is unlimited and does not have a form, but inside a pot, the space is limited by the pot.  When the pot is broken, the space inside the pot becomes infinite.  The pot is superimposed on   space.  Here, the pot is compared to the mind, space is compared to consciousness.  Mind is superimposed on consciousness.  The infinite consciousness is limited by the mind.  Mind is full of experiences, when the experiences merge in infinity, the mind becomes infinite.  This is called the limitation theory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As explained before, ahamkara(ego) is the pure &#8220;I&#8221; feeling.  Whereas, the reflected consciousness(experiences) is anthakarana.  When ego is identified or connected with reflected consciousness, we have the feeling that &#8216;I am experiencing&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>&#8220;chayahankarayor alkyam taptayah pindavan matam&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>&#8220;Identification of ego with reflected consciousness is like a glowing hot iron ball&#8221;.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">(The heat is not inherent in the iron ball.  When it is heated, the iron ball acquires heat and it glows like fire).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The ego and the experiences of our life are separate, but when we identify ego(I sense) with experience, then it will become &#8216; I experience&#8217; meaning &#8216;my experience&#8217;.  For an example, sadness is our experience.  When we identify this experience with ego, we feel &#8216;I am feeling sad&#8217;.  Yogis do not identify ego with their experiences(eg Karma yogis).  Karma yogis do their duties (karma) without identifying themselves with the results of their karma.  This is explained in Bhagavad Gita as &#8220;Thy right is to work only,but never with its fruits;  let not the fruits of action be thy motive, nor let thy attachment be to inaction&#8221; BH.GITA(2,47).  When we identify ego(&#8220;I&#8221; sense) with the experience(result) of our duty, then the result will affect us.  It is a wrong identification and it is a problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Another identification of the ego is with the consciousness(witness).  Ego is the only vritti(thought), which is connected with the consciousness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Ego identified with consciousness is also a wrong identification, because ego is a vritti(thought), and consciousness is not a vritti.  The identification of ego and consciousness is natural, and it is due to karma and ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>&#8220;ahankarasya tadatmyam cicchaya deha sakshibhih; sahajam karmajam bhrantijanyam cha trividham kramat&#8221;(verse 8)</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>&#8220;Identification of the ego with the reflected consciousness, body and witness is natural, due to karmas, and due to ignorance &#8211; each of these respectively&#8221;.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Knowledge destroys the identification of ego with consciousness, and it destroys karma.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The identification of ego with the reflected consciousness makes the body sentient.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In deep sleep, ego does not manifest.  There is no identification with the body and the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In dream, ego partially manifests.  Ego identifies with the impressions in the mind, and not the body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the waking state, ego manifests completely.  Ego identifies with the reflected consciousness, body and world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We have to analyse that, why and how does this identification occur?  The answer is, it is due to &#8220;MAYA&#8221;.  Maya is not mere illusion.  Maya has two powers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1.  AVARANA SHAKTI(obscuring, veiling, concealing power)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2.  VIKSHEPA SHAKTI(projecting power)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> Sri Adi shankara&#8217;s famous example of the &#8216;snake and rope&#8217; explains this concept.  In dim light, a rope appears like a snake.  In bright light, the real rope is revealed.  It is a very simple example, but it explains the &#8216;concealing and projecting&#8217; concept.  The first is, the obscuring or veiling of the original rope.  The next is, the projection of the non reality, snake. The snake does not exist, it is only an illusion. When the real is obscured, unreal appears.  When Brahman is obscured, the mind and its identification appear.  This example is an individual experience(microcosm).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It can be applied at the universal level(macrocosm).  The whole universe is the manifestation of Brahman.  When Brahman is concealed, the universe in name and form is projected.  In other words, the universe is projected by concealing Brahman.  Universe is an appearance.  Just like foam and bubbles in the ocean, the name and form manifest from Brahman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>&#8220;Shakti dvayamhi mayaya vikshepa-avritti-rupakam; Vikshepa-shaktir lingadibrahmandantam jagat srijet&#8221;(verse 13)</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>&#8220;Maya has two powers, projecting and veiling; The power of projection creates the world &#8211; from subtle body to the universe&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The inner difference between the consciousness and the mental activities, as well as the external difference between the consciousness and the world are concealed, and it is due to ignorance.  Worldly life is due to this concealing power.  Reflected consciousness is superimposed on the wittness(consciousness).  It is Brahman(consciousness), which appears in the form of mind(reflected consciousness).  When the obscuring power disappears, the projection in the form of appearance disappears.  In this context disappearance means, the world of appearance will not disappear from our sight. Instead, when maya is understood, our interaction with the world and our beliefs will change in a positive manner.  For example, when we view the open sky in day light, it is blue in colour.  The sky is colourless, but it appears in blue, due to Rayleigh scattering.  The shorter wavelength light(blue) from sun, is absorbed by the gas molecules in the atmosphere.  The molecules reflect the absorbed blue light in different directions.  It gets scattered all over the sky, and gives a blue appearance to the sky.  The sky appears the same, but the understanding of this scientific fact, dispels our ignorance about the colour of the sky.  Like this, the understanding of maya, dispels our ignorance that the universe in name and form are different from Brahman.  Modification is for the world and not for Brahman.  When the ignorance is dispelled, one can realise that, the observer(seer) is Brahman and the observed(seen) is the world.</p>
