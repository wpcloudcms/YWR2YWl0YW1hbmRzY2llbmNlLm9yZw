<p>PAROKSHA
JNANA TO APAROKSHA JNANA </p>
<p>(Indirect
to direct knowledge)</p>
<p>Brahma
jnana, the knowledge of the Self, is the ultimate knowledge.&nbsp; It is not attained instantly.&nbsp; There are various steps towards the ultimate
realization.&nbsp; A mumukshu (student of
Brahma jnana) has a basic knowledge of Brahman, however he considers Brahman or
Atma as far away from him; and so he does not identify with Brahman.&nbsp; He has objective knowledge of Brahman, paroksha
jnana (indirect).&nbsp; A jnani understands
Brahman as not separate from him and his experience of Brahman is aparoksha jnana
(direct).&nbsp; It is so direct in the sense
that a jnani do not experience anything other than Brahman.&nbsp; His realization is so evident from the way he
views this world.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Initially, a student will receive Brahma jnana from
scriptures and through a guru.&nbsp; At this stage
he will have an indirect knowledge of Brahman (paroksha jnana).&nbsp; Gradually, his knowledge becomes deep and
leads to aparoksha jnana.&nbsp; Therefore,
Brahma vidya is a transition from paroksha jnana to aparokha jnana.&nbsp; Mahavakyas of the Upanisads play an important
role in this transition.&nbsp; To understand
this concept more clearly, Vedanta explains this with the famous tenth man
story.&nbsp; The story goes thus:&nbsp; ten students tried to cross a high flowing
river.&nbsp; They went on a boat.&nbsp; After crossing the river, to ensure safety,
the leader of the gang started to count each one of them.&nbsp; Every time he counted he left himself and
counted the rest of them, and so he always got the number nine.&nbsp; This caused frustration in the gang.&nbsp; Each one counted in turn and each time they
repeated the same mistake of forgetting to count the person who counted.&nbsp; By ignorance, they thought that one among
them drowned in the river.&nbsp; Each time
they counted the tenth man was missing.&nbsp;
All the time the tenth man was very much there, but they failed to count
him and they did not realize his presence.&nbsp;
They started lamenting over his missing.&nbsp;
During that time a wise man came that way and enquired about their cause
of worry.&nbsp; Seeing their plight he helped
them to count.&nbsp; When the wise man
counted, there are exactly ten people.&nbsp;
He declared that &#8216;the tenth man is here&#8217;.&nbsp; The students were surprised and at the same
time happy about the wise man&#8217;s declaration.&nbsp;
The wise man said, &#8216;tenth man is very much here safely but he was hidden
from your vision by ignorance&#8217;.&nbsp; This
story from the scripture is exactly applicable to our knowledge
transition.&nbsp; Brahman is very much
here.&nbsp; We are Brahman; however we are
unaware of it.&nbsp; Our knowledge is hidden
by ignorance.</p>
<p>Vedanta explains seven important steps towards
knowledge.&nbsp; They are ajana (ignorance),
avarana (hiding), vikshepa (projection), paroksha jnana (indirect knowledge),
aparoksha jnana (direct knowledge), shoka nivritti (removal of sorrow), tripti
(contentment).&nbsp; Now let us see each step
briefly in connection with the explained story.</p>
<p>1. Ajana &#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ajana is ignorance.&nbsp; Ignorance gives us confusion and worry.&nbsp; In the example, due to ignorance the students
did not count themselves properly and the result is worry.&nbsp; In real life, forgetting our real infinite
nature, we lament over petty things.</p>
<p>2. Avarana &#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; avarana is hiding the truth.&nbsp; In the example, the tenth man was always not
caring to count himself and he was counting the rest.&nbsp; Ignorance hides the truth.&nbsp; He has hidden himself (left himself) due to
ignorance.&nbsp; In real life, we forgot our
real infinite nature and it is difficult to connect with it now.</p>
<p>3. Vikshepa &#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vikshepa is projection.&nbsp; As soon as ignorance hides the truth, the
truth is projected in another way.&nbsp; In
the example, as soon as the leader of the gang failed to count himself (the
tenth man), it is projected that the tenth man is missing or rather drowned in
the river.&nbsp; When the truth is hidden by
ignorance, another is projected in the same place.&nbsp; In real life, when something is not clear, we
project our own imagination on it.&nbsp; On
this basis, we compare and consider our self as week in some matters and feel
our self to be excellent in some matters and impose a fake personality on our
self.</p>
<p>4. Paroksha jnana &#8211; It
is the indirect knowledge.&nbsp; In the
example, the wise man came and took the responsibility of counting.&nbsp; In a detached manner he counted and said,
&#8216;the tenth man is here&#8217;.&nbsp; This gave
knowledge to the gang that all are safe and not missing.&nbsp; Likewise, when we read the scriptures, we get
the knowledge that, &#8220;Brahman Asti&#8221;, that is Brahman exists.&nbsp; Though we are relieved to an extent by
knowing our true nature, we feel that Brahman is somewhere and we have to reach
there or attain it.&nbsp; We do not feel that
the scriptures are telling about our nature.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>5. Aparoksha jnana &#8211; It
is the direct knowledge.&nbsp; It can be said
as the realization.&nbsp; It is so
direct.&nbsp; In the example, when the wise
man helped the students to count, they realized that the tenth man is that left
out man, and all the time he was with them.&nbsp;
After realizing, when the leader of the gang counted again, he was quick
to realize that, &#8216; I am that tenth missing man&#8217;.&nbsp; Likewise, when we progress in sadhana, we
realize that, &#8220;I am Brahman&#8221; and &#8220;I am not a samsari&#8221;.&nbsp; This is aparoksha jnana.</p>
<p>6. Shoka nivritti
&#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the end of worry.&nbsp; This stage comes after realization.&nbsp; In the example, the realization that the
tenth man is not missing relieves them from worry.&nbsp; Likewise, when the ignorance is removed and
the truth is realized, the world no longer disturbs a jnani.&nbsp; </p>
<p>7. &#8211; Tripti &#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the self contentment.&nbsp; In the example, the whole gang is content
that no one is missing and they remained in that content stage.&nbsp; Likewise, when the ignorance is removed, a
jnani remains as a content person even in worldly life.&nbsp; He realizes his nature as infinite.</p>
<p>These are the seven
important steps for the transformation from paroksha jnana to aparoksha
jnana.&nbsp; Every student of Vedanta
undergoes these seven steps.</p>
<p>Just like a wise man
entering the scene of the lamenting gang of students and declaring that the
tenth man is not missing, he is with you; in the same way, with the help of a
guru a powerful statement, mahavakyas of the Upanisads, like &#8220;Tat Tvam
Asi&#8221;, meaning, &#8220;You Are That&#8221; vehemently declares and removes
the cloud of ignorance.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
These seven stages of
knowledge are given to chitabasa in a drop by drop manner.&nbsp; Chitabasa is the reflected consciousness
covered by ignorance.&nbsp; The stage in which
chitabasa identifies itself with the subtle and gross bodies is called
superimposition.&nbsp; This is the stage of
vikshepa.&nbsp; Now the chitabasa is subject
to bondage, and it suffers due to the idea of doer and enjoyer.&nbsp; When the chitabasa gets first the paroksha
jnana and then the aparoksha jnana the veil of ignorance is removed and it
realizes, &#8216;I am not different from Brahman&#8217;.&nbsp;
The condition of the chitabasa is reflected in the mind and body.</p>
<p>A jnani passes these
seven stages of knowledge.&nbsp; He may live
in worldly life and experience the tantrums of material world, but he is relieved
internally by the proper understanding of his existence.</p>
<p>There are two types of
obscuring principle.&nbsp; One principle hides
the truth.&nbsp; The other principle does not
make the realization clear.&nbsp; These two principles
in sanskrit are known as,&#8217; Na Asti, Na Bhati&#8217;.&nbsp;
&#8216;Na Asti&#8217;, means &#8216;does not exist&#8217;.&nbsp;
It implies that Brahman does not exist (hides the truth).&nbsp; A layman is not aware of Brahman.&nbsp; When such a novice enters Brahma vidya, he is
not aware of Brahman.&nbsp; His &#8216;Na Asti&#8217; obstacle
is removed by paroksha jnana.&nbsp; It gives
knowledge that Brahman exists.&nbsp; The next
obscuring principle is &#8216;Na bhati&#8217;, meaning &#8216;not self evident&#8217;, is removed by
aparoksha jnana (direct knowledge).&nbsp;
Aparoksha jnana makes Brahman self-evident and thus removes the second
obstacle.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When you analyze
further, there are two more divisions of aparoksha jnana.&nbsp; They are the very refined divisions of the
aparoksha jnana.&nbsp; The first division in
sanskrit is known as,&#8217; Brahman asti&#8217;, meaning &#8216;Brahman is self-luminous&#8217;.&nbsp; The second division is known as,&#8217; Aham
Brahma&#8217;, meaning, &#8216;I am that Brahman&#8217;. &nbsp;These
two divisions are removed gradually by step by step aparoksha jnana.&nbsp; In the initial stages of aparoksha jnana,
there is not much difference between the aparoksha jnana and paroksha
jnana.&nbsp; However, when we advance further
the finer divisions are well evident.&nbsp; We
will be able to differentiate between finer stages of &#8216;Brahma asti&#8217;, and &#8216;Aham
Brahma&#8217;.&nbsp; When the mind is purified of
impurities, a strong statement like mahavakyas makes the mere scriptural
knowledge transform to direct knowledge.&nbsp;
Mahavakyas exists in scriptures for this purpose.&nbsp; Thus Brahma vidya takes one gradually from
paroksha jnana to aparoksha jnana.</p>

<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/articles/the-three-types-of-knowledge/">THE THREE TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE</a></h2>
<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">Dec 13, 2019</span> | <a href="/category/articles/" rel="category tag">Articles</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Life is a series of experiences.&nbsp; We observe this world through the five sense
organs.&nbsp; When this data goes inside our
mind it is converted into knowledge and stored as memory.&nbsp; Our experiences and knowledge are related to
each other.&nbsp; There is no use of experience
if it does not become knowledge and available to us when needed as memory.&nbsp; Knowledge and memory are absolutely needed to
take life forward and it is attained through various experiences.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There are three types of knowledge based on our
experience.&nbsp; The first is the knowledge
we gain through the sense organs.&nbsp; This
knowledge is called pratyaksha jnana.&nbsp;
Prati + aksha = pratyaksha.&nbsp; Prati
means objects placed in front of the sense organs.&nbsp; Aksha literally means eye; but in scriptures
this word is used to indicate all the sense organs.&nbsp; Therefore, the experience and knowledge
gained by using sense organs is called pratyaksha jnana.&nbsp; For example, when I see a rose flower, I know
it is a rose flower by my past experience.&nbsp;
This is pratyaksha jnana.</p>
<p>The second type of knowledge is, many times we infer
or conclude by our experience and observation.&nbsp;
We come to conclusion by thinking.&nbsp;
Sometimes, we close our eyes, think deeply, and come to conclusion.&nbsp; In this context, the mind and the intellect play
an important role.&nbsp; The knowledge we gain
by the working of the mind and intellect is called the paroksha jnana.&nbsp; It is otherwise known as inferential
knowledge or indirect knowledge.&nbsp; Para +
aksha = paroksha.&nbsp; Para in this context
means that which is above the range of the sense organs.&nbsp; We need data to infer and come to conclusion;
and that data is provided by the sense organs.&nbsp;
The knowledge of science and the entire realm of faith in religion are
based on paroksha jnana.&nbsp; For example, we
have not seen an atom, but we infer that there is an atom.&nbsp; Likewise, many have not seen the Himalayas,
but we gain knowledge of the Himalayas from the experiences of the other
people.&nbsp; This is called paroksha jnana,
otherwise known as indirect knowledge.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Knowledge of Brahman is neither pratyaksha jnana nor
paroksha jnana.&nbsp; Brahman is
existence.&nbsp; No one can deny that
knowledge.&nbsp; We may not be aware of it but
we cannot deny it.&nbsp; For example, if
someone asks me &#8216; Do you exist, are you alive&#8217;?&nbsp;
I do not need an evaluation by the sense organs or a second thought from
my mind to answer &#8216;Yes, I am very much alive&#8217;.&nbsp;
This reply spontaneously comes from &#8220;I&#8221; the Being.&nbsp; I always exist as a witness.&nbsp; It is here the third type of knowledge come
in to the scene.&nbsp; The knowledge that does
not use the sense organs, the mind or the intellect is called aparoksha
jnana.&nbsp; Apara + aksha = aparoksha.&nbsp; It is transcendental knowledge.&nbsp; All the spiritual practices are there to
experience this knowledge.&nbsp; In a way, one
can say aparoksha jnana as an extremely direct knowledge.&nbsp; Even the mind and senses are not used for
aparoksha jnana.&nbsp; The entire experiences
of the sense organs, mind, and the knowledge of what we know and what we do not
know are based on aparoksha jnana.&nbsp; It is
the source of all knowledge.&nbsp; It is the experience
and knowledge of the Atma.&nbsp; Aparoksha
jnana is the feeling of existence.&nbsp; It is
our real nature.&nbsp; &nbsp;Aparoksha jnana is stronger and direct than
the pratyaksha jnana and paroksha jnana.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When we are in deep sleep, we do not experience the
mind, senses, body or intellect.&nbsp; During deep
sleep there are no experiences; however, when we get out of sleep, we get a
feeling, &#8220;I slept well&#8221;.&nbsp; Who
gives this experience?&nbsp; It is the
Consciousness, the Atma, which is there in the three states of waking, dream
and deep sleep, gives this experience.&nbsp; This
direct experience is aparoksha jnana.&nbsp; One
and only the knowledge of the Self, Atman, is applicable for aparoksha
jnana.&nbsp; No other knowledge is as direct
as aparoksha jnana.&nbsp; All the other knowledge
either fall in the category of pratyaksha jnana&nbsp;
or paroksha jnana.&nbsp; They all need
the help of the senses or the mind.</p>
<p>Aparoksha jnana is so direct that no one can deceive
this knowledge.&nbsp; In stula drishti (gross
vision), the sense organs are applied and sometimes they hide the truth.&nbsp; Our vision is based on our mentality.&nbsp; In sukshma drishti (subtle vision), there are
a lot of chances for wrong perception; because what you think is that you infer
and conclude.&nbsp; Science and religion are
based on sukshma drishti and this is the main reason for many contradictions in
science and religion.&nbsp; The third type of
vision is tattva drishti or satya drishti.&nbsp;
It is otherwise known as aparoksha jnana.&nbsp; There is no chance for wrong perception in
this because it is direct realization.</p>
<p>The common question many people ask is, if aparoksha
jnana is direct perception, then why not everyone realize it.&nbsp; Why is it restricted to only a few
people?&nbsp; The only answer is we all are
covered by ignorance.&nbsp; For example,
during winter, fog and clouds cover the bright sunlight.&nbsp; When the fog and clouds move away, then the
already existing sun shines brightly.&nbsp;
Likewise, when the ignorance is removed by knowledge the already
existing Atma shines brightly.&nbsp; Jnani removes
the ignorance by practice and so he has direct perception of the truth.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Ignorance can be removed in many ways.&nbsp; It can be removed by reading the scriptures,
that is philosophy and it is the path of jnana (knowledge).&nbsp; It can be removed by the control of the mind
by meditation and it is dhyana yoga.&nbsp; It
can be removed by devotion and it is bhakti yoga.&nbsp; It can be removed by doing selfless service
and it is karma yoga.&nbsp; One can practice
any one of this with dedication or can combine one or two of this and practice
it with dedication.&nbsp; The goal is to
purify the mind from ignorance.&nbsp;
Realization will manifest only in a purified mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though when one has knowledge, due to
the impurities in the mind realization will not manifest.&nbsp; Mind will not assimilate the truth due to
past impressions and desires.&nbsp; Without realization
knowledge will be an additional burden to lead the worldly life.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the path of jnana yoga, a mumukshu or a student
gets this knowledge from the Guru and scriptures.&nbsp; When a student gets this knowledge initially,
it is the indirect knowledge (paroksha jnana).&nbsp;
A student very well understands about Brahman as explained in the scriptures.&nbsp; Due to the impurities of the mind he will not
get realization, but he has knowledge.&nbsp;
He thinks that Brahman is somewhere else, and fails to realize &#8220;I &#8211;
the Brahman&#8221; is explained in the scriptures.&nbsp; In that sense, all the Upanisads are biography
of our Self given by the Rishis.&nbsp;
Upanisads does not explain about our fake personality instead, it
explains about our real nature.&nbsp; By
reading, contemplation and by spiritual practices one gradually realizes that
Brahman is no one else, but my SELF.&nbsp;
Initially, one gets paroksha jnana from the scriptures, especially the
mahavakyas, however it gradually turns in to aparoksha jnana.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Aparoksha jnana bring deep changes in a person.&nbsp; He will transact with the world as a common
man, but deep inside he has a firm conviction that &#8220;I am
Brahman&#8221;.&nbsp; Disturbances of the
external world no longer disturb him.&nbsp;
The major difference between the paroksha jnana and the aparoksha jnana
is paroksha jnana gives knowledge that Brahman exists and aparoksha jnana gives
knowledge that Brahman is my real Self, the Atma.&nbsp; </p>
<p>These are the three types of knowledge based on the
philosophical point of view.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There are another set of three types of knowledge
based on the gunas.&nbsp; They are sattvic
knowledge, rajasic knowledge and tamasic knowledge. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sattvic nature is peace, clarity and
equanimity.&nbsp; The knowledge to see unity
in diversity is sattvic knowledge.&nbsp; It
helps one to see the non-dual existence in different objects.&nbsp; It is the true knowledge and it gives the
whole picture of existence.</p>
<p>Rajasic nature is activity, agitation and
passion.&nbsp; Rajasic knowledge is to see the
world as bits and parts.&nbsp; This knowledge
will not allow seeing the world as one. &nbsp;Rajasic
knowledge views each part as separate from the rest.&nbsp; It creates boundaries and causes confusion
out of ego in the name of self respect.</p>
<p>Tamasic nature is ignorance and inertia.&nbsp; Tamasic knowledge is to see a part as the
whole.&nbsp; It will never see the whole due
to stubbornness and ignorance.&nbsp; Tamasic
knowledge revolves around a small world and it thinks that this is the
whole.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When you see the whole it is sattvic knowledge.&nbsp; When you see the bits and parts it is the
rajasic knowledge.&nbsp; When you see the bit
and believe it to be the whole then it is tamasic knowledge.</p>
<p>These are the three types of knowledge based on the
gunas.&nbsp; Gunas lead to the attainment of
right knowledge; and right knowledge leads to realization.</p>

<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="/my-views/difference-between-the-intelligence-and-the-intellect/">DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INTELLIGENCE AND THE INTELLECT</a></h2>
<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">May 27, 2019</span> | <a href="/category/my-views/" rel="category tag">My Views</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center">                                     </p>
<p>Intelligence and intellect are different; yet they
are connected in a subtle way.&nbsp; In the
material life it is difficult to survive with anyone of these.&nbsp; They both are absolutely needed and they go
hand in hand.&nbsp; Let me point out some of
the basic differences between the intelligence and intellect according to my
view. </p>
<p>1. Intelligence is the base or source of this
Universe.&nbsp; Intelligence is the Universal
consciousness or the complete awareness.&nbsp;
When I say awareness it is not the awareness state of the mind or brain.
&nbsp;It is beyond mind and brain; whereas,
intellect is the information we gather using the intelligence. </p>
<p>2. Intelligence is infinite.&nbsp; Intellect is always limited.&nbsp; Whatever field it may be, one cannot gather
information beyond a particular limit.&nbsp;
Human intellect functions only from the limited data it has gathered.</p>
<p>3. One can understand life as a whole only from
intelligence.&nbsp; If you understand life
using intellect, then you will understand life partially.&nbsp; </p>
<p>4. The experiences of the intelligence are permanent;
whereas, the experiences of the intellect are temporary.&nbsp; It changes with time.&nbsp; When we gather a lot of information, it
sometimes confuses us and makes us indecisive.&nbsp;
It gives us a false feeling that &#8216;I know everything&#8217;.&nbsp; They live life with stagnated knowledge.&nbsp; Today&#8217;s children have high intellectual knowledge;
they are confused, ignorant and lack wisdom.&nbsp;
In this internet age it is very easy to gather information, but they do
not have time to touch the intelligence by spiritual methods.</p>
<p>5. Intellect is absolutely needed for the material
life.&nbsp; It gives us the knowledge to
discriminate, and it helps us to excel in the choice of our field.&nbsp; It is the objective knowledge; whereas,
intelligence is the subjective knowledge.&nbsp;
Intelligence and intellect are deeply interconnected.&nbsp; Only by using intelligence one can gather
information in the intellect; at the same time, without the intellect one
cannot use or exhibit intelligence.&nbsp; Only
human beings have the capacity to use the intelligence.&nbsp; The problem is some people take intellect as
intelligence.</p>
<p>6. When people live their life only with
intellectual knowledge, then they live a limited life.&nbsp; The scripture says gather intellectual
knowledge and work using intelligence, because only intelligence can give peace
of mind.</p>
<p>7. Intellectual knowledge will have value only when
you compare your knowledge with others.&nbsp;
If you do not have the same knowledge as others then your knowledge will
either be appreciated or degraded; it depends on the knowledge of the other
person.&nbsp; This reflects in our personality
and leads to either superiority or inferiority complex.&nbsp; In material life a person is judged by wealth
and intellect; whereas, intelligence makes one realize that every life is
important in its own way.&nbsp; Each life is a
dot of energy in this infinite Universe and without which this Universe is not
complete.</p>
<p>8. Intelligence makes you to think deeply and
intellect is a great obstacle for that.&nbsp;
Intellect brings one to immediate conclusion by referring to past
experiences and so intelligence is always hidden by the intellect.&nbsp; </p>
<p>9. Intellect and ego are closely related.&nbsp; For example, if the intellect decides that &#8216;I
am an Indian&#8217;, then the intellect and ego revolve around it.&nbsp; It immediately compares with other people and
brings an idea of favoritism or disrespect for others.&nbsp; Intellect and ego are used mainly for the physical
existence.&nbsp; It identifies with the
physical body.&nbsp; Basically we use
intellect for survival that is for our physical health, to appease our hunger, and
for our protection, for this we disturb the entire atmosphere using the
intellect; whereas, intelligence is our true nature.&nbsp; We are sat-chit-ananda Brahman.&nbsp; However, this nature is covered by intellect.</p>
<p>10. It is not possible to know about all the objects
or situations in the Universe.&nbsp; If we
have practiced touching the intelligence by meditation or by chanting mantras,
then when the situation arises, intelligence will reveal the necessary
knowledge to the intellect.&nbsp; One can call
it as a perfect guess or intuition.&nbsp; Thus
intelligence helps us to survive in any situation.</p>
<p>Without realizing the nature of the intelligence, we
identify with the physical body, intellect, ego, and life in a limited circle
of do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts.&nbsp; Only spirituality
can help us realize our true nature which is pure intelligence.</p>

<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">Apr 25, 2019</span> | <a href="/category/articles/" rel="category tag">Articles</a></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education must be had with interest and enthusiasm. &nbsp;Learning is a lifelong process.&nbsp; Our formal education may end in a few years;
however learning continues till life time.&nbsp;
Our education, education system and educators must sow the seed of
learning in us, and it is helpful for our lifetime.&nbsp; In education, education system and educators
part1, I have expressed facts and my views about the meaning of education, the
present education system and the need for quality education.&nbsp; In education, education system and educators
part 2, I would like to express facts and my views about the role of the
educators (teachers), role of the parents in the education of their children, responsibility
of the students and the importance of spirituality in education.</p>
<p><strong>Role
of the educators (teachers) in educating the students</strong></p>
<p>Educators or teachers have an important role in the
education of a student.&nbsp; Parents, siblings,
relatives, friends and society have only a secondary or supplementary
role.&nbsp; Even though parents are the first
teachers of a child, after a certain age parents leave their children in the
hands of the teachers with confidence that the teachers will mould their
child.&nbsp; If a teacher fails to fulfill this
responsibility then she has crossed her professional ethos and disrespected her
profession.&nbsp; This behavior earns only
disrespect for the educator.&nbsp; Teaching is
not a profession.&nbsp; It is a service.&nbsp; It is not a 9AM to 5PM job.&nbsp; A teacher has to prepare very hard to deliver
during working hours.&nbsp; In Vedantic term
teaching is said as a life style.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The prime duty of a teacher is to teach a student by
understanding his talent, knowledge, intelligence, emotional quotient,
behavior, interest and tendencies.&nbsp; A
teacher can receive help from the parents in this endeavor.&nbsp; No two students are alike.&nbsp; Each student is different in their own
way.&nbsp; Understanding a student and
imparting the right education with the common syllabus for all students and molding
the student for success is the talent and the intelligence of the teacher.&nbsp; It is a real task.&nbsp; The intellectual capacity, interest,
emotional quotient of each student are different.&nbsp; The course material or syllabus will be very
easy for one student, at the same time it may be very difficult for the other
student.&nbsp; It is the duty and the talent of
the teacher to ease out the differences and bring out equally successful result.&nbsp; A good teacher will not make the student feel
the stress of learning.&nbsp; No student will
prefer to get low marks or like to sit idle at home.&nbsp; If a student&#8217;s interest, his incapability,
emotions are not addressed in the right way then it will lead to frustration
and depression in the student.&nbsp; A student
(whether in school level or higher level) will not do pranks or roam around
without studying unless he has some serious fear, emotional imbalance or
interest in some other field.&nbsp; Instead of
immediately punishing the student or embarrassing him in any way, it is the
duty of the teacher to observe the student and guide him in the right path.&nbsp; </p>
<p>During the phase of education a student will spend more
time with the teachers and the educational institution than with his parents at
home.&nbsp; In such a situation, a student
will never disrespect a teacher or let the educational institution down if they
are the real cause for the upliftment of his life.&nbsp; Respect must be received and not demanded.&nbsp; A teacher must help the students to come out
of their ignorance without damaging the dignity and self-respect of the students
by passing personal comments, insulting his personality, intellectual capability,
family background and his situations in life.&nbsp;
Pointing out mistakes and accusing one for their mistakes is an indecent
way of correcting others and this will only create deep emotional scar in a
person.&nbsp; He must be shown the right path.
&nbsp;You can only correct a person by showing
the right path and never by accusing or insulting a person for their
mistakes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Students must be encouraged to ask questions.&nbsp; The ideas in the books must not be forced on
the students.&nbsp; A good teacher will
encourage the students to think one point in many ways.&nbsp; This develops thinking capacity in the students.&nbsp; Memorizing type of education will not improve
the creativity of the students.&nbsp; If a
student understands the subject then he can answer the questions easily.&nbsp; Therefore, instead of being an answer book a
teacher must encourage the students for innovative thinking. &nbsp;A teacher must not be a mere dictator; instead,
a motivator to achieve the students goal. </p>
<p>In the kinder garden level, before a child learns to
think, walk or play, he is loaded with information in the name of rhymes.&nbsp; By this a child thinks that learning is
stressful and he ignores education before understanding it.&nbsp; Teachers, parents and education system must
have a little patience to see the child grow before loading information.&nbsp; A child must be first taught to concentrate
else he will spend the whole time studying leaving little time for other
activities in life.&nbsp; It is very common to
see today&#8217;s children learning for more than ten hours and leaving no time for
other activities in life.&nbsp; If he spends
eight to ten hours to study school lessons what will be his situation when he
goes to higher education level like research level.&nbsp; He will be good for nothing other than
studying and earning.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
today this is the pathetic situation of many highly educated people.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>How
to excel as a teacher</strong></p>
<p>1. A teacher in the first place must have the
passion to teach.&nbsp; Teaching is a service
or charity where a teacher shares his/her gained knowledge with others.&nbsp; By this, the student gets its benefit and the
knowledge of the teacher also improves.&nbsp;
Teaching is a noble profession.&nbsp;
Teaching is not a profession or job which someone can choose when they
do not have any other option or can choose it merely for remuneration.&nbsp; Teachers are respected for their teaching
ability.&nbsp; Teaching establishes a
relationship between the teacher and the student.&nbsp;&nbsp; A good teacher is seen as a guide, father or
mother by a student.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A teacher is
a role model for the students.&nbsp; A teacher
is an observed object for the students.&nbsp;
A teacher must be aware of this responsibility and behave accordingly.&nbsp; Especially, when the students are very young
(kinder garden and basic school level), a teacher creates a lasting impact in
the students mind.&nbsp; Students observe the
way a teacher communicates, how he behaves, his mannerism, knowledge, teaching
style, lifestyle all are under observation of the students.&nbsp; A student, later in his life develops his
personality based on this.&nbsp; Therefore, a
teacher must be aware of this responsibility and privilege and act
accordingly.&nbsp; A teacher touches many students
life and this is the greatest privilege for the teacher.</p>
<p>3. A teacher must have clear subject knowledge, good
resources like books or access to the library.&nbsp;
Every day he must prepare for the classes to bring the subject back to
memory.&nbsp; He must update the subjects
regularly to have the latest knowledge in the chosen subject.&nbsp; He must have good communication skill,
teaching methods and presentation methods.&nbsp;
If a teacher has good subject knowledge and lack communication skill or
presentation techniques, then the students are not benefited by that subject knowledge.
&nbsp;Knowledge is always in thought
form.&nbsp; A teacher&#8217;s knowledge passes to
the student through sound and again it becomes thought in the students mind. &nbsp;Therefore clear explanation of the subject
material is very important.&nbsp; Only a good
student can be a good teacher.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; A teacher&#8217;s
manner of teaching must not raise any doubt in students mind.&nbsp; Some teachers confuse the subject matter and
make the subject boring.&nbsp; This should be
avoided.&nbsp; Main and strong points in the
subject must be repeated and at the same time over repetition must be
avoided.&nbsp; A good teacher will definitely
capture the students attention by his subject knowledge, communication skill,
presentation methods and his gentle behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Every
class must have an introduction section which summarizes the portions covered
in the previous class, the main headings for the present class and gradually
build up the subject matter based on the main headings.&nbsp; A dedicated teacher with good teaching spirit
will have all these qualities automatically.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; If a
teacher enjoys teaching then the students will enjoy listening to him.&nbsp; If the teacher focuses on cent percent result
exclusively, then the students are driven towards the result, which results in
frustration in students.</p>
<p>Teaching is an art; it has to be developed according
to the subject, situation and the student&#8217;s capacity.&nbsp; Students must be treated in the right sense.&nbsp; They must not be discouraged; at the same
time they must not be over encouraged.&nbsp; Over
encouraging a particular student will create an insecure feeling in other
students.&nbsp; Instigating jealous among
students is a himsa (subtle torture).&nbsp; </p>
<p>A good teacher must always be a good listener.&nbsp; A good teacher talks to the parents, not to
complain about the student or to find fault with the parents, but to uplift the
student as a combined effort.&nbsp; Shouting
at the parents in front of the children (students) for the children&#8217;s mistake or
passing harsh criticism of the student to the parents is a barberic act.&nbsp; This will affect the student&#8217;s mentality in
an adverse way.&nbsp; This must be avoided by
the teachers and the educational institutions.&nbsp;
Teaching atmosphere must be serene and happy.&nbsp; Schools or collages are not psychological
torture cells.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Ancient teachers of India gave the students knowledge,
freedom, accommodation, food and trained the students as good human beings, as
scholars and as great personalities; whether modern teachers and educational
institutions have this ability is a great question.</p>
<p><strong>Role
of the parents in education</strong></p>
<p>Parents also have an important role in educating the
child; after all it is for their own children the teachers are trying
hard.&nbsp; Parents must cooperate with the
teachers and educational institutions to educate the child.&nbsp; The main duty of the parents is to give
psychological and physical security to the children.&nbsp; It is very absurd to expect the lost dream
life of the parents in the children.&nbsp;
Parents must know the talent, interest and capability of their child by
closely observing them.&nbsp; Talk to the
children with patience to know their mind.&nbsp;
It is the responsibility of the parents to find the educational
institution suitable for the child&#8217;s ability and talent.&nbsp; It is also the responsibility of the parents
to keep the atmosphere at home as serene, calm and free from emotional
disturbances.&nbsp; Giving too much material comforts
to the child at the very young age itself, weakens the child emotionally.&nbsp; Parents adjusting to the whimsical demands of
the child at home will make the child to expect the same from others.&nbsp; When it is not possible he becomes
emotionally weak, frustrated and he suffers.&nbsp;
Children must know the value and meaning of &#8220;NO&#8221;; only then
they can adjust to any situation in life.&nbsp;
Parents must train the child to adjust to any physical, social and
psychological atmosphere.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Teachers alone are not responsible for a student&#8217;s
education.&nbsp; It is the duty and
responsibility of the parents to ensure the child with right atmosphere at home
and attend to the child&#8217;s needs and desires with maturity.&nbsp; Parents fighting in front of the children
will definitely create a feeling of insecurity in the child.&nbsp; When the child grows up, it will have the
same fighting tendency with everyone.&nbsp; A
child&#8217;s observation power is very sharp in its early stage (up to 7 to 8
years).&nbsp; During this period a child
observes everything like a sponge from the parents and teachers and later
develops its personality based on this observation.&nbsp; Parent&#8217;s immature, irresponsible and indignity
in behavior or lifestyle will lower the energy of the child and this in turn
will affect the child&#8217;s studies and other activities.&nbsp; They either become very aggressive or they
become introvert, frustrated and depressed. &nbsp;In future, this affects the child&#8217;s very personality
and behavior.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Parents must have the patience to hear their children.&nbsp; If they criticize, judge, insult or prejudice
the child while he is speaking out his mind, then the child will not approach
the parents the next time.&nbsp; Therefore,
the child must be respected with kindness and compassion even in his worst
moment without ego, hatred, anger or disrespect.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Responsibility
of the children or the students</strong></p>
<p>Children must recognize and understand the
importance of education in their life and must realize that it is for their
good the parents and teachers are struggling.&nbsp;
Children must have a marginal fear of respect for the parents and
teachers.&nbsp; Today&#8217;s children have tremendous
information by using technology, but lacks wisdom.&nbsp; Children must recognize the love and respect given
to them by parents and teachers.&nbsp; They
must not take the parents or teachers for granted.&nbsp; Some children take love, respect and
facilities given to them for granted and in turn they disrespect the parents
and demand facilities from parents.&nbsp; They
must realize that not all get the right education and opportunity to study and
they must utilize the facilities and opportunity.&nbsp; They must take it as a privilege in the right
sense.&nbsp; If a child understands the
importance of education then he will not waste the rare privilege.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Children must open up their mind either to the
parents or teachers about their difficulty in learning or education.&nbsp; They must train their mind to adjust to
different situations, circumstances and train themselves to cross barriers and
hurdles to reach a high position.&nbsp; They
must understand that opportunities are rare and they must use the opportunity
in the right way to avoid repenting later.&nbsp;
They can take individual decisions, however up to a certain level, till
they attain intellectual maturity, it is advisable to follow the decision taken
by the elders.&nbsp; Independence is not
disobeying.&nbsp; Many children/students take
freedom or individuality in the wrong sense and they are going on the wrong
path.&nbsp; Wrong decisions make us more
dependent.&nbsp; Ignoring everyone in the name
of independent thinking may make them land in problems.&nbsp; Therefore, till they attain mental maturity
to deal with life situations it is advisable to talk to the elders about their
ideas and views.&nbsp; Education is an
important as well as rare opportunity and the children must use it properly.</p>
<p><strong>Importance
of spirituality in education</strong></p>
<p>It is common to see well educated people behave in
an authoritative, rude manner and disrespecting others.&nbsp; They are not content, matured and they
involve in many unlawful acts.&nbsp; They try
to control others in the name of education by their arrogant behavior and in
the end they lead a distasteful, frustrated and lonely life.&nbsp; THEN, what is the quality of education they received
so far?&nbsp; Therefore, Spirituality is
absolutely needed at the basic school level, secondary school level and higher
education level.&nbsp; Spirituality means
respecting the spirit (soul) or knowing the spirit.&nbsp; It is more than respecting the
attributes.&nbsp; Spirituality makes a student
understand life.&nbsp; It will help a person
to have a balanced mind at the time of stress and strain.&nbsp; It will make a person to behave in a humble,
cultured and dignified way.&nbsp; It will help
the youth to understand the feeling and emotions of others and to behave in a dignified
and well mannered way.&nbsp; These are the
results of quality education combined with spirituality. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>A guru instigates us to think. </p>
<p>A teacher imposes facts and theories he has studied
on the students. </p>
<p>A lecturer just gives lecturer on what he knows and
gives no place for students opinion.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s time limit and financial situation give
place only for teachers, lecturers, and not gurus.&nbsp; Spirituality must be combined at all levels
of education.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Education is the combined effort of the parents,
teachers, students and the education system.&nbsp;
Each one has an important role from their side.&nbsp; Education does not stop after getting a
degree or job.&nbsp; It is life long
process.&nbsp; A person who has received
quality education is known from his composure, dignity and mannerism.&nbsp; A person&#8217;s personality is the mirror of his/her
family background, upbringing, disciplined lifestyle, teachers and the quality
of the education he/she received all these years.&nbsp; Education is a privilege, only a few in this
world are fortunate to get it.&nbsp; Let us
not waste our education.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"></h2>
<p></p>
<p>WHAT IS EDUCATION</p>
<p>The renowned educationalist K.K. Pillai in his book Curriculum,
teaching and evaluation has said, &#8220;Education is defined as an activity of
life, by life and for life.&nbsp; Education is
a venture of faith &#8211; the faith that there is a divine spark in every individual
far beneath the surface of flesh and marrow; and it is possible to realize this
&#8216;Self&#8217;. &nbsp;Thus education is considered as
a process of Self realization&#8221;. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda often said, &#8220;Education is the
manifestation of the perfection already in man&#8221;.&nbsp; Education must help a student to manifest his
hidden abilities.&nbsp; Knowledge is inherent
in man; only thing is he should bring it out by education.&nbsp; Quality education targets this purpose.&nbsp; Education must give confidence, general
knowledge, subject knowledge and it must train us to overcome obstacles and
hindrances in life.&nbsp; A person&#8217;s talents
and knowledge are hidden by ignorance.&nbsp;
Ignorance is the main reason for all the difficulties in life.&nbsp; The education we receive must remove that
outer crust of ignorance.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Education is a continuous and life long
process.&nbsp; It is ignorance to claim that
&#8216;I am a completely educated person or I have completed my education&#8217;.&nbsp; We may have completed our degree; however
education goes beyond medals and degrees.&nbsp;
Education must make a person extrovert and inclusive.&nbsp; Education must morally, intellectually,
physically and spiritually uplift a person.&nbsp;
Quality education always develops a person&#8217;s body, mind and soul.&nbsp; Body must be nourished by appropriate food,
yoga and exercises.&nbsp; The conscious and
subconscious minds must be taken care of by implementing good positive
ideas.&nbsp; Soul must be satisfied by giving
spiritual knowledge.&nbsp; Therefore, a best
education system must include intellectual knowledge and spiritual
knowledge.&nbsp; Students must be trained to
have control over the five senses and they must be given knowledge to control
the mind.&nbsp; If all these basic aspects of
education are not addressed, then the education we receive will uplift us
intellectually and drag us down in the other three areas namely, in moral,
physical and spiritual levels.&nbsp; The
present education system mostly targets the intellectual capacity of a
student.&nbsp; As a result he is safe by
position, status and financial abundance; however, he suffers emotionally,
physically and he feels spirituality as unwanted.</p>
<p>Education is a gift of life.&nbsp; Not all are exposed to the right kind of
education.&nbsp; Many people think that learning
to read, right and to speak good English is education.&nbsp; It can be called as literacy.&nbsp; It is only the beginning of education.&nbsp; English is a very good language of
international acclaim. &nbsp;That is all.&nbsp; Education is far more than a mere language. &nbsp;A language alone cannot mould a person.&nbsp; One must know to use the language in the most
productive manner.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Education must bring out the best in man.&nbsp; The knowledge we imbibe through various ways
form our character, strengthen our mind and improve our intellectual capacity,
so that a person becomes a self reliant person in every way.&nbsp; Does the education we receive today satisfy
all these qualities &#8211; It is a big question which the parents, teachers,
educational institutions and curriculum developers have to think about.</p>
<p>THE PRESENT EDUCATION SYSTEM</p>
<p>The present education system targets materialistic
gain and authority through position and status.&nbsp;
Any skill can give these gains.&nbsp;
If a student is not trained morally and spiritually at the young age,
then he can be powerful and rich but he will be an insecure person.&nbsp; Success in terms of money and position,
without maturity of mind, will make a person arrogant and he leads an insecure
life.&nbsp; This type of education system targeting
material gains has been going on for many years now.&nbsp; Reflection of such an education system is
seen in the society; it is common to see many highly educated people being weak
minded and frustrated.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the rat race to hold degrees, the quality of education, morality, creativity, basic interest and talents are sidelined or ignored.  As a result, such type of education opens up a Pandora&#8217;s Box of degree holders and not the real educated people who help the society.  These degree holders are spread throughout the world and encourages bringing the next generation of same type of degree holders.  The present education system fails to make a student to be well versed in a subject.  Even the rank holders in a particular subject have an average knowledge in the subject.  Education system tries to cover a lot of subjects touching each one a little.  There is no continuity or connectivity in the subject they study and students just select the subjects which have job opportunities with good salaries.  Ultimately students lack deep knowledge or specialization in a particular subject.  Students are trained to get cent percent marks, their creative wings are cut and they are tailored to fit in the present education system.  Students are given projects without proper guidance or care and the students in turn look out for some people whom they can pay and complete their projects.  What is the purpose of such projects?  Neither useful for the students nor for the society.  All these give unnecessary pressure to the students.  Today&#8217;s students are emotionally so weak and they are not trained to handle even a little pressure.  An education system failing to understand the pulse of the student will not lead them to an intelligent path. </p>
<p>Education has become a lucrative business in the society today.  Education targets the parent&#8217;s money and has a little aim for the student&#8217;s individual talents and interest.  This leads to frustration in students.  Any intellectual and frustrated person will harm the family and society.  His education is a burden for others.  The present education has been narrowed to a profession meaning it has little or no significance to life.  Such education only leads to conflicts, misery either in the personal or the professional level.  </p>
<p>There are many school boards existing in India, each one following their own curriculum.  When all these students from different boards enter college education, are the curricula offered by the universities  prepared to handle their diverse intellectual capacities? if not there will be difference in the way they qualify out of the higher education.  What is wrong in having a uniform education board at the school level?  What do the students really gain from such different school boards?  What is more absurd is &#8211; to enter professional courses students from different education boards have to face a common entrance examination.  All these create an aversion towards education for the student.  How can such diverse education boards break social barrier, which is supposed to be the main objective of education?  It is a mechanical way of education.  It makes a student&#8217;s life more chaotic.  </p>
<p>It is very good and important to have quota system
based on community and economy.&nbsp; It gives
an opportunity and financial concessions for the economically and socially weak
students to pursue their interest.&nbsp;
However, it must not give concession to have a degree without being
really qualified for it (giving them a pass mark because they belong to a socially
weak community).&nbsp; If this happens then a
Pandora&#8217;s box of degree holders will be produced and this is one of the main
reasons for unemployment.</p>
<p>BASIC NEEDS FOR A QUALITY EDUCATION</p>
<p>1. First and foremost, the education system must not give over pressure to the students at the same time it must not keep them idle too.  Intellectual knowledge along with spiritual knowledge must be taught to the students; only then they will have the emotional and mental strength to deal with various pressures in life with emotional stability.  Spiritual knowledge means it is not making them a monk or sanyasi.  They must be taught the basics of life and must be given practice in any recognized method for emotional control; else they will not know to handle stress in life.  The main problem with the present education system is the present system is giving pressure to the students and the students are not able to cope up to that pressure.  </p>
<p>2.  At the school level, the students must be taught the importance and relevance of each subject in practical life; else they will not develop interest in a subject and just like the flock of sheep they follow the subject which is trendy in the society.  Many students study engineering and medicine because they blindly follow the parents or the society.  They are not aware of the importance of other subjects.  Education must relate to each person else it is an artificial education. </p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Students
must not be psychologically tortured with the study material by the teachers or
parents.&nbsp; If a student finds interest in studies
he cannot remain idle without studying.&nbsp;
If a student is not interested in studies, the teachers and parents must
try to find the reason behind his disinterest.&nbsp;
Instead, if they blame him or torture him mentally or physically it will
only make the situation worse. &nbsp;One
cannot show the right path to a person by blaming or arguing with them.&nbsp; Only by encouraging a person one can correct
a person.&nbsp; It is a basic human
psychology.&nbsp; Even a very poor student in
studies must be encouraged with patience to study well.</p>
<p>4.  Education must go beyond gathering of information.  It must instigate the young mind to think deeply with concentration.  It is very hard to find students thinking in a very deep and proper way.  Our education system, teachers, parents, family or anyone in the responsible position do not teach us to think.  They teach us everything else other than to think.  Right thoughts make a person and wrong thoughts destroy a person.  The problem with today&#8217;s students are, because of the technological advancement, they have wide knowledge, but their knowledge is not deep.  They lack concentration.  Their mind is drawn in various directions.  Their knowledge must be channelized lest their knowledge is a waste.  </p>
<p>5.  Today&#8217;s children have a lot of comforts and too much of physical comforts dampen the creative mind and make them emotionally weak.  Students must be made emotionally strong at the young age itself; else they will easily succumb to even silly difficulties in life.  Impatience and not knowing to handle situations lead many students to the drastic step of suicide.  If a student does not know to handle even this pressure, then how are they going to handle profession and family life in future?  Probably, this is one of the reasons they fail in any one of them &#8211; either professional life or family life.  They somehow manage the profession because they need salary and position, so their next choice is to break up their own family and the result is many emotionally weak broken families in the society.  Education must give us independent way of thinking but not arrogance.  If arrogance and non-adjustment is our way of life then it destroys our peace of mind.  Students must be educated about life in the proper way.    </p>
<p>6.  Pressure cooker way of life at the very young age disturbs the mind in a drastic way.  Nowadays, it has become a fashion to employ psychologist in the educational institutions itself.  Why?  Are schools mental asylums?  This only shows the inability of the parents and children to handle their own wards.  If the parents and teachers cannot handle a student or a child, then what is their role in their education?  The students must be made to understand the need of education in life and its benefits in the right way. </p>
<p>Emotional quotient can be only raised by spiritual
quotient.&nbsp; If the soul power depletes
then the emotional, physical and intellectual power depletes
automatically.&nbsp; Intellectual power without
spiritual power only gives arrogance and it is wrongly mistaken as self-confidence.&nbsp; Self-confidence makes a person humble and it
makes a person adapt to situations easily.&nbsp;
Therefore, along with subject knowledge atleast a basic spiritual
knowledge must be introduced at the junior, senior and higher levels of
education.&nbsp; Intellectual knowledge and
technology without wisdom is not good for mankind.&nbsp; We all see its repercussion in the society
today.&nbsp; We all are affected by its
negative effects in many ways.&nbsp; A person
is what his thoughts have made him.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Education must physically, morally, intellectually, and
spiritually uplift a person; else it is waste of money and energy.&nbsp; Education and learning are life long
process.&nbsp; Therefore, the education a
person receives must encourage him to learn and not just to get marks and earn
a living.&nbsp; By learning, we accumulate
knowledge and we act from that knowledge. </p>
<p>It is very common to see the highly educated people,
people with status in society and highly successful people in the society with
very weak, sick, frustrated and non-contented mind.&nbsp; If this is the case, then what is the quality
of education they received and what is the quality of life they lead.&nbsp; Education has uplifted them intellectually,
but degraded them emotionally, morally and spiritually.&nbsp; </p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>1. Intellectual knowledge must be combined with
spiritual knowledge, only then there will be responsible, self-confident,
contented and successful educated people in the society.&nbsp; This uplifts the society at a large level.&nbsp; </p>
<p>2. A marginal difference will come if the grade
system is introduced back in the education system.&nbsp; This reduces the pressure and the unnecessary
competitive spirit in the students mind.&nbsp;
Competition is healthy but if it exceeds a limit then it spoils the
mind.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; It is very
important to encourage intellectually good students.&nbsp; At the same time, it is the duty of the
teachers to uplift the intellectually average and weak students.&nbsp; It shows the teaching capacity and the
intelligence of the teacher to uplift the intellectually weak students.&nbsp; Only 10% of the students will be
intellectually good students.&nbsp; It is the
challenge of the institution and teachers to uplift the rest 90% without
discouraging them emotionally. </p>
<p>Education has improved and gone far away, very
widely; but how deep it has gone is a question.&nbsp;
Only the future will say whether the dreams of the renowned
educationalists views about education will be satisfied or not.&nbsp; Let us wait and watch.</p>
