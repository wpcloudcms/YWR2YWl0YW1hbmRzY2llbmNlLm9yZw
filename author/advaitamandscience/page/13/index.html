					<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://advaitamandscience.org/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">Sep 17, 2014</span> | <a href="https://advaitamandscience.org/category/articles/" rel="category tag">Articles</a></p>
<h4>                                                                            KARMA YOGA</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">A human being is the combination of the five basic elements in the universe namely the space, air, fire, water and earth.  However, these basic elements alone will not make a human being.  His body is the combination of these basic elements.  In reality, a human being is a conscious being with unlimited power.  He is guided by his <i>karmas (</i>actions<i>)</i>.  Even though a person is identified by his body, he is respected and valued by his nature (<i>svabhava</i>), actions (<i>karma</i>) and behaviour.  A person&#8217;s nature and attitude in life is pivotal in doing the actions.  A person has an opportunity to become rude and cruel by his attitude and actions, and at the same time he has the opportunity to become kind and affectionate by his attitude and actions.  Among all the creations in the world, only man has the rare opportunity to know his Self.  A person&#8217;s nature changes according to his knowledge.  According to the knowledge, the <i>bhavana</i> (attitude) of the mind changes and the action also changes accordingly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Inspite of all the materialistic knowledge and technical skills in the world, a person does not know to lead his life in peace.  His external knowledge has given him ego (<i>ahankara</i>) and as a result his actions have led him to injustice and various sins.  He earns and spends his valuable earnings in the most <i>adharmic</i> way.  He lacks knowledge in <i>dharma</i> (justice) and <i>adharma</i> (injustice), in <i>sat</i> (reality) and <i>asat</i> (non-reality).  Knowledge to lead life and to reach the goal is given in the vedas and this is <i>Karma yoga</i>.  Without understanding this basic principle, people assume everything as predestined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Every being is a conscious being, Atma, covered by the combination of the basic elements, the body.  The path which makes one understand that he is Atma, is <i>dharma</i>.  Till the Atma realizes that it is separate from the body, it takes repeated births.  <i>Adharma</i> denies one from this knowledge.  <i>Karma</i> (action) arises from body (<i>kayikam</i>), speech (<i>vachikam</i>) and mind (<i>manasam</i>).  If a person&#8217;s soul is hurt, the whole world will get its impact, the only thing is we are not able to realize it.  It happens because Atma is non-dual.  For example, if there is a wound in the head, the whole body is aware of it.  In the same way, when a person is hurt or insulted, it will have an impact in the universal mind.  All <i>karmas</i> will have a reason, but all reasons will not lead to <i>karma</i>.  <i>Karmas</i> will have bondage, but reasons will not have bondage.  <i>Karmas</i> will lead to result and attachment.  If the result is in the form of comforts, wealth, name and fame, honour etc, then it will lead to desire and gradually to attachment.  Repeatedly we perform <i>karma</i> to satisfy the desires and it gradually leaves likes (<i>raga</i>) and dislikes (<i>dvesha</i>) in a person, which is the seed for the next birth.  <i>Karma</i> does not erase desires, it leaves likes and dislikes in the mind.  The world is in the mind and not outside.  A person&#8217;s wealth, relatives, position, or status will not be with him till the end.  Only his mind remains with him till the end and so mind should be taken utmost care.  The difficulties of the body are till the death, it is <i>Maya</i>, but the mind travels beyond death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When we perform <i>karma</i>, it leaves behind the likes and dislikes of that <i>karma</i>, which influences to accept or reject the next <i>karma</i>.  When we perform an action by <i>karma yoga</i>, it removes the likes and dislikes.  When we have likes and dislikes, the actions are affected by it.  The likes and dislikes lead to <i>moha</i> (passion) and it covers the discriminative power.  It reduces the understanding power of an action.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Vedanta says that attitude (<i>bhavana</i>) is important in performing an action and this is <i>karma yoga</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>Karma</i> (actions) can be categorized as many types.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>
<i>Nitya karma</i> or <i>niyatham karma</i> &#8211; daily duties</li>
<li>
<i>Kamya karma</i> &#8211; desire prompted duties</li>
<li>
<i>Naimittika karma</i> or <i>prayachita karma</i> &#8211; duties on special occasions</li>
<li>
<i>Nishida karma</i> or <i>vi-karma</i> &#8211; actions to be avoided</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">Attitude of a person is important while performing an action as well experiencing the result.  The attitude defines a person.  Since attitude is dependent on the <i>bhuddhi</i> (intellect), karma yoga is also known as <i>bhuddhi</i> yoga.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>&#8221; Thy right is to work only, but never to its fruits; let the fruit of action be not thy motive, nor let thy attachment be to inaction&#8221;</i>  Gita, verse (2,47).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The above verse explains four points</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>One has the right to do an action.  Each action has a choice.  To deal with a particular situation is our choice.</li>
<li>Once an action is done, there is no choice for the result.  One cannot decide on the result.  Once an action is done, the law of nature takes the responsibility to return the result.</li>
<li>The law of nature returns the result based on the attitude of our action.  Our attitude is dependent on our knowledge.</li>
<li>Sometimes failure makes us weak.  We hesitate to venture in to an action with the fear of facing failure.  Attachment to inactivity should be avoided.  The inherent <i>gunas</i> (nature) in a person will not allow a person to remain ideal.  Each one has a particular <i>guna</i> and a person does an action according to his <i>guna</i>.  A person can remain ideal externally; however his mind will be always active and planning about actions.  The existing impressions of likes and dislikes make a person to perform actions.  At the same time, one should not fight and complain about failure.  The results are received according to the existing impressions.  Try to accept the result as it is with humble attitude.  One&#8217;s action must satisfy his values.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b>Attitude of a person while performing nitya karma(daily duties)</b></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>There should not be any likes or dislikes while performing the daily duties (either household or professional).  Equal importance must be given for the family, profession and society.  If one concentrates on the profession alone, ignoring the family and society, later on the family and society will ignore him.  If he gives importance to the family alone, then there will be no progress in the professional life.  If the society is ignored, he will remain as a stranger to the society.  Therefore, one must train himself to give equal importance for the family, profession and society.</li>
<li>When we do a favour to others, we normally expect gratitude from them.  In case, if they fail to show that gratitude, we feel hurt or insulted.  In reality, Atma is non-dual.  One is doing a favour to the Atma, and not to that particular person.  If that particular person does not return that gratitude, someone else will return that favour in time of our need.  Most of the time help comes to us from other sources and not from that particular person.  Therefore, one must do a favour with an attitude that &#8216;I am helping God&#8217; and this is called &#8220;Work is worship&#8221;.</li>
<li>Do not try to imitate others action, because an action is done efficiently according to one&#8217;s maturity and mentality.  A person is efficient in performing his own duty and performing others duty out of jealous or envy will not exhibit his own talent.</li>
<li>Once an action is done, there should not be any feeling of guilt, because feeling of guilt bothers the action and its result.  At the same time, if a wrong action is done then there should be a feeling of guilt because it helps us correct our actions.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">When an action is done with these points in mind, it definitely removes the likes and dislikes.  <i>Sastra</i> says that in addition to these, a householder is advised to do some additional duties &#8211; <i>Yagna, dhana</i> and <i>tapas</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There are five different types of <b><i>yagna</i></b> to be performed by a householder.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>
<i>Deva yagna</i> &#8211; It is the daily prayer offered to God for a period of ten to fifteen minutes.  It relaxes the mind, keeps it stable and instil a value of detachment and selfishness.  It purifies the mind and prepares one for a higher state of spiritual advancement.</li>
<li>
<i>Rishi yagna</i> &#8211; Gratitude must be shown to the <i>rishis</i> because they revealed us the Truth.  Gratitude is shown by learning their scriptures and attending <i>satsang</i> (spiritual discussions).</li>
<li>
<i>Pitru yagna</i> &#8211; It is the duty to be done to the ancestors, parents and elderly people in the family.  The elders in the family should take care of the youngsters in the family.  When the youngsters grow up, it is their turn to take care of the elders (by that time they will be very old) and the younger ones.  This cycle must go on forever.  Even a few kind and affectionate words from the youngsters will give a lot of happiness to the elders, especially the very old people.</li>
<li>
<i>Manushya yagna</i> &#8211; The relatives and guests coming to our place of living must be taken care and respected.  They have to be treated carefully and fed well.</li>
<li>
<i>Bhuta yagna</i> &#8211; It is the gratitude shown towards the nature for helping us to survive.  It includes the worship of the five basic elements and the cow worship etc.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b><i>Dhanam</i></b> is sharing.  The important duty of the householder is, they have to serve the people of the other <i>ashramas</i> namely <i>brahmachari</i>, <i>vanaprastha</i> and <i>sanyasi</i>.  A householder should provide all the facilities for the students and allow them to concentrate on their studies.  By sharing, the desires and passion are reduced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b><i>Tapa</i></b> &#8211; We experience the outside world through the body, mind and <i>indriyas</i> (senses).  Controlling the mind and <i>indriyas</i> is <i>tapas</i>, by this we can experience the inner world.  <i>Tapas</i> helps to experience the inner Self.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b>The attitude of a person while performing <i>Kamya karma</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">These karmas are not part of the daily duties, but they are done as a part of entertainment.  <i>Dharma</i> should be followed in performing the <i>kamya karma</i>.  There should be a limit in performing the <i>kamya karma</i> and even this <i>karma</i> is to be reduced in due course of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b>The attitude of a person while performing the <i>prayachita karma</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">These karmas are usually performed as a remedy for the failures and difficulties in life.  It is better to accept the failure and learn from the mistakes, however if one feels to perform the <i>prayachita karmas</i>, then it should be accompanied with charity.  The <i>prayachita karma</i> differs according to the needs of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b>The attitude of the person while performing the <i>nishida karmas</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">These karmas are improper karmas.  With the attitude that such karmas disturb the family and society, they are to be abandoned.  Even some negative emotions like anger, jealous, criticism are considered as nishida karma and it should be avoided.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Bhagavad Gita advises <i>karma yoga</i>.  One enjoys the <i>karma</i> and is least considered about the result.  Therefore, there is no failure or success.  The attitude behind the action is very important.  <i>Karma yoga</i> does not leave the impression of likes and dislikes.  A person who does <i>karma</i> <i>yoga</i> has a clear goal and his action is not wavered by success or failure.  His stable mind induces him to jhana yoga, which is the next step towards liberation.  A <i>Karma yogi</i> renounces the mind and do not renounce his actions.  <i>Karma yoga</i> is the mean and not the end.  It leads a person to liberation by erasing his ego (<i>ahankara</i>), desire, anger and hatred towards others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This is the essence of <i>karma yoga</i> as explained in Baghavad Gita.</p>

					<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://advaitamandscience.org/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">Jul 23, 2014</span> | <a href="https://advaitamandscience.org/category/articles/" rel="category tag">Articles</a></p>
<p>				&nbsp;</p>
<h4>                                                            SADHANA CATUSTAYA (BASIC QUALIFICATIONS)</h4>
<h4></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">Any field in education demands a basic qualification.  Only then that education becomes easier and a continuous process.  If a person enters in any field of education without a proper qualification, he may not understand the intricacies of that field.  Deep understanding of Advaita philosophy also demands some basic qualifications.  These basic qualifications are known as <i>sadhana catustaya</i>.  <i>Sadhana catustaya</i> makes the mind pure for grasping this subtle philosophy.  If one has not practiced <i>sadhana catustaya</i> then the truths of Vedanta will not go deep inside him.  He may find it difficult to practice Vedanta in practical life.  It is advisable to practice <i>sadhana</i> <i>catustaya</i> so that his mind becomes prepared for this <i>Atma vidya</i>.  The nature of qualification one needs in the spiritual realm is of the nature of purity of the mind (<i>citta-suddhi</i>) and single pointedness of the intellect (<i>citta-ekagrata</i>).  Only an <i>adhikari</i> (qualified person) uses this knowledge to the maximum extend.  Without <i>sadhana catustaya</i> the profound facts of Vedanta are not understood in the correct sense and meaning.  It is not to discourage anyone from the study of Vedanta.  It is only to emphasis that this knowledge is benefit to the extend they are qualified.  The very venture in to Vedanta and practicing various spiritual disciplines enables one to become as <i>adhikari</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>Sadhana catustaya</i> is the fourfold qualification and it is explained in a number of occasions in scriptures.  However, it is explained very clearly in Tattva bhodha and Vivekachudamani of Sri Sankaracharya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The <i>sadhana catustaya</i> are</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1. <i>Viveka</i> or differentiation</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2. <i>Vairagya</i> or dispassion</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">3. <i>Samadi-satka-sampatti</i> or the six diciplines (or virtues) of the mind</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">4. <i>Mumuksutvam</i> or the desire for liberation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1. <b><i>Viveka</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The knowledge attained is known as the intellect; it is the intellect which differentiates between the right and the wrong, pleasure and pain, honour and dishonour and so on.  This differentiation determines the quality of knowledge one has attained.  Sometimes the intellect differentiates person according to their race, caste, material wealth etc.  Such cases show that the knowledge attained is not proper.  Vedanta differentiates between the permanent and ephemeral.  Sankaracharya&#8217;s Tattva bhodha says, &#8220;<i>Viveka</i> is the understanding that Brahman alone is permanent and everything apart from it is ephemeral&#8221;.  Only humans have the capacity to differentiate due to proper understanding.  Right understanding results in differentiating the permanent end ephemeral.  This differentiation is known as the &#8220;<i>nitya-anitya-vastu-viveka</i>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This Universe has a beginning and an end.  Our body also has a beginning and an end.  It is not present before the birth or after death, and hence it is impermanent.  However, by wrong notion we assume the body to be the Self.  Since the body and universe are impermanent, the mind and intellect which gives experience of the world through the body is also impermanent.  However, all these changes take place in a changeless substratum called Brahman.  This understanding and knowledge about the changeless Brahman and the rest is termed as <i>viveka</i> in Vedanta.  <i>Viveka</i> is the very basis of the remaining three aspects of <i>sadhana-catustaya</i>, namely <i>vairagya</i>, <i>samadi -satka-sampatti </i>and<i> mumuksutvam.  </i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2. <b><i>Vairagya or dispassion</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The second aspect of <i>sadhana catustaya</i> is <i>vairagya</i> or dispassion.  The mentality to lose anything at any time without any mental disturbance is called <i>vairagya</i>.  The absence of desire to enjoy pleasure is <i>vairagya</i>.  When <i>viveka</i> is strong <i>vairagya</i> happens automatically.  When one has clear idea that everything other than Brahman is temporary, then <i>vairagya</i> automatically happens.  When the mind does not pursue after the infinite pleasure of the senses, then it turns towards the Self.  A finite pleasure does not leave the mind without causing pain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">3. <b><i>Samadi-satka-sampatti</i></b> &#8211; It is the third aspect of <i>sadhana catustaya</i>.  It is a set of six disciplines of the mind-intellect.  Each one of them is explained briefly,</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify">
<li>
<i>Sama</i> or mastery of the mind &#8211; the mind is a continuous flow of thoughts.  Preventing the mind from running towards the world of objects is called <i>Sama</i>.  It is to make the mind introvert so that it helps the spiritual progress.  If the mind is clear about the temporary nature of the worldly pleasures then <i>sama</i> comes automatically.</li>
<li>
<i>Dama</i> or mastery over the senses &#8211; the mind experiences the world through the sense organs.  The sense organs are grosser than the mind and they are comparatively easy to be controlled.  If <i>viveka</i> and <i>vairagya</i> are strong then it is easy to practice <i>dama</i>.</li>
<li>
<i>Uparama</i> or withdrawal &#8211; it is the natural withdrawal of the senses and the mind from external objects.  By withdrawal the mind remains peaceful.  It will not wander towards the finite pleasures.  In vivekachudamani Sankaracharya says, &#8220;<i>Uparama</i> is that condition of the thought waves in which they are free from the influence of external objects&#8221;.  When <i>viveka</i> and <i>vairagya</i> are strong then <i>uparama</i> happens automatically.</li>
<li>
<i>Titiksha</i> or forbearance &#8211; life is a series of experience gained through the body, mind and intellect.  The capacity of the mind to view the pairs of opposite experiences like heat and cold, pain and pleasure, insult and honour with equal mentality is appreciated.  The mentality to take the pain, sorrow and insults in their stride without becoming overly pre occupied with them is called &#8220;<i>titiksha</i>&#8220;.  If the mind is stable in pleasure and success then it will be overcome by their opposites like pain, failure, sorrow, insult etc.  When the mind has a definite goal then it faces all the challenges, difficulties and obstacles with ease.</li>
<li>
<i>Sraddha</i> or faith &#8211; faith is very important in the spiritual path.  Often faith is misunderstood as blind belief.  The difference between faith and blind belief is, faith is belief with deep understanding, and blind belief is belief with no proper reasoning or understanding.  Faith is the trust in the words of the Guru and Vedanta.</li>
<li>
<i>Samadhana</i> or concentration &#8211; it is the single pointedness or concentration of the mind.  Like in any other field <i>samadhana</i> is very important in the spiritual field.  By <i>viveka</i> and <i>vairagya</i> the mind automatically become more concentrated on the Self.  The practice of <i>samadi-satka-sampatti</i> help to attain success and peace in whatever endeavour we pursue.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">4. <b><i>Mumuksutvam</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The fourth aspect of <i>sadhana catustaya</i> is <i>mumuksutvam</i>.  It is the burning desire for liberation.  A <i>mumuksu</i> seeks Brahman with fiery passion and urgency.  A <i>mumuksu</i> lives every moment of his life in the diligent pursuit of the Truth.  He is totally possessed by his desire for Self Realization.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">A person with high level of <i>sadhana catustaya</i> is said to be a spiritually matured person and his knowledge will lead him to realize the Self.  Atleast, a basic level of <i>sadhana catustaya</i> is needed to grasp and understand the subtle truth of Vedanta.  One can gradually improve this in due course of time.  The facts of Vedanta makes one naturally a <i>viveki</i> and a <i>vairagi</i>.  It does not mean that such people lead a secluded life.  They understand about the Truth and the ephemeral nature of the world and they deal with worldly activities accordingly and peacefully.</p>

					<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://advaitamandscience.org/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">Jul 14, 2014</span> | <a href="https://advaitamandscience.org/category/my-views/" rel="category tag">My Views</a></p>
<h4>                                                                                  COMMUNICATION</h4>
<h4></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify">Art of communication is very important to maintain a relationship.  Any relationship is an exchange of energy and communication plays an important role to make the bondage stronger.  Words are an expression of thoughts and feelings.  There are times when we fail to express the feelings through words.  Sometimes we purposely speak contradictory to our thoughts.  Sometimes we exactly express our thoughts.  Whatever way we choose to express, our relationship with any person is established through communication.  Hence utmost importance is given for communication.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">One can improve the communication skills at any point of time in life.  Our words reflect our experience in life.  If we have experienced a decent and sophisticated life, then our communication reflects it.  Suppose,  we have experienced a painful life, then our communication reflects that too.  Moreover, our communication reflects our culture and values in life.  When the thoughts are less, the words are also less.  When the words are less it enhances the inner energy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When we go through the greatest epic Mahabharata, we will be able to notice mainly four types of communication which are very common in life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>Dheenadha</i> &#8211; this is the manner in which the King Dhiridhrashtra communicates.  This type of communication highlights only the negatives in life.  They fail to see the positive side of life.  Those people always thing about the emptiness in life.  Too much of attachment towards life prevents them from seeing the achievements in life.  The result is they are left only with complaints and dissatisfaction.  They are too interested in finding fault with others, by that they hide their own mistakes.  Their possessiveness prevents them from adjusting with others.  Their communication is filled with worries, complaints and criticism.  Naturally others may reject their company.  Their mind is weak due to over expectation and fear and it is well reflected in their words.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>Durabhimanada</i> &#8211; this is the manner in which King Duryodhana communicates.  This type of communication reflects their dominating mind.  Through thoughts and words they want to control others.  They are commanding and authoritative.  They strongly believe that their ego as the Supreme and due to this they find it uncomfortable to even communicate in a pleasing manner.  They take others for granted.  Normally people try to avoid their company because their words always hurt others.  They fail to listen to others words and the communication is always one way.  Such type of communication worsens any type of relationship because there is no space for others to live together.  Their ego is too big to accommodate any other person.  They always view others as smaller than their own personality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>Nisheyadha</i> &#8211; this is the manner in which Dronacharya communicates.  People who communicate in this manner always look for safe corner.  They always hesitate to communicate.  They are too protective and they never interfere in anyone&#8217;s business fearing that blame or responsibility may fall on them.  They never express their views in public.  They have very low Self esteem about themselves and due to this they even hesitate to think, assuming in mind that their ideas are not worth and it may be rejected or ridiculed.  Any relationship becomes stronger by sharing and giving.  If someone fails even to share the ideas, then there is no point in communicating with them.  One must live up to the situation and share the ideas as and when needed by kind useful words.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>prajodanadha</i> &#8211; this is one of the most perfect way to communicate and it is in this manner Bishmacharya communicates.  The communication must be always inspirational and it must always be helpful for others to take positive decisions.  Such people never talk about the weakness of others, at the same time they have the capacity to correct others mistakes by using proper words.  Basically, such inspirational words come from the respectful thoughts they have for others.  As said before, words are only expression of thoughts.  Everyone likes to be present in their company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Communication is the result of our own likes and dislikes.  If the communication is too sharp then it is hated by everyone; if it is too blunt then everyone ignores it.  In my view, communication skills have to be checked and improved to maintain relationships.  The wound created by words takes time to heal than any physical wound.  Our own world is created by words, and for that reason they have to be given utmost care else we will be surrounded by loneliness.  Communication has the power to make or destroy our own world.</p>

<h4 align="center">SPIRITUAL EVOLUTION</h4>
<p align="center">
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Different stages of spiritual evolution lead one from the basic stage of Religion to the highest state of Advaitam.  Spiritual evolution is nothing but the different stages in our awareness.  Our awareness changes according to our knowledge.  The difference between Religion (dvaitam) and spirituality (Advaitam) depends on our Consciousness.  If one is conscious of only the mind, body and intellect, then duality is prominent.  In one is conscious of the body, mind, intellect, along with the consciousness of the Self, then it is the beginning of Advaitam.  If one is conscious of the Self alone, then it is Advaitam.  Therefore, Dvaitam or Advaitam depends on the consciousness in which one exists.  One has to pass through the gradual process of spiritual evolution for this natural transition.  However, all over the world only Dvaitam is prominent and commonly practiced.  Until realized, though it is the Reality, Advaitam appears as a concept.  To realize this Reality one must have the knowledge about it and it is the Advaita Philosophy.  Dvaitam is not a separate state, but it is the basic state and it leads to Advaitam.  Advaitam is the highest state, where the mind dissolves in Reality.  When a person sleeps he is in his Self, but he is not aware of it.  So the state of Absolute Consciousness is sarcastically said in Vedanta as a state where one is awake while asleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Duality is the experience of life through sense perception.  Through duality it is difficult to get the exact essence of life because the likes and dislikes of the senses always shadow the perception.  The world exists as such.  It is only the likes and dislikes that create deep impressions on the mind.  The whole aspect of life is divided in to two concepts as <i>Shiva</i> (masculine) and <i>Shakti</i> (feminine).  A dualist cannot think anything beyond that.  Duality is the basics of all the Religion and rituals.  The whole life is based on duality.  Sense organs enhance the concept of duality through the sense perceptions.  The senses establish the concept of opposites like good and bad, rich and poor, right and wrong, heat and cold and so on.  It is the perception which makes this difference and decides the opposites.  When we involve more in sense perceptions, the concept of duality gets deeper.  However, at the same time if there is no duality there is no creation.  In the primordial state there was no duality.  When the evolution of the Universe started, duality also came in to existence.  Now the point is, one should not be trapped in this duality.  If one limits oneself in the duality, he will not know the beyond.  People who practice Dvaitam (duality) do not accept Advaitam.  They get locked in the concept of duality.  Duality is the source of all pleasure, and so one hesitates to look beyond.  At the same time duality is the source of all the sufferings too.  When one experiences an unbearable suffering, they try to look beyond.  Due to suffering they cannot handle duality, at the same time they cannot transcend it too.   The sense organs give us full freedom in one way.  However, it also limits the knowledge of our Self.  Due to this, one is completely unaware of his real nature and is left in the dark.  To transact in this world one has to remain in duality, at the same time he should be conscious of the Self.  This unique state makes him explore beyond the limitations.  In short like a tortoise, while interacting with the world one has to stretch out his senses, and when the interaction is over he has to hold back his senses and be aware of the inner Self.  This makes one a well balanced person.  By this, he understands that it is not the sense organs that operate the senses, rather the &#8216;Being&#8217; beyond which operates the senses.  When one realizes that &#8216;Being&#8217; he has direct perception of the world and not through the interpretation of the senses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Moving from Dvaitam to Advaitam is a natural process of evolution.  In Dvaitam, one differentiates the Supreme power from him and names it as God.  He fails to realize that he himself is that Supreme power.  In Dvaitam, each one is different from one another and there is gradation among living being also.  The assumed distance between God and man gave way to all kinds of rituals.  This assumed distance is the cause for the fear factor in God in Dvaitam.  Devotion is mainly due to fear or due to the need for the satisfaction of desires.  Only in the higher stages of Dvaitam, devotion is due to pure and inseparable love.  Rituals are celebrated based on the region, language and mainly spiritual evolution.  Thus, the supreme power is divided into different aspects, though the supreme power is beyond any aspect or attributes.  The Supreme power is seen through different emotions; form and attributes are imagined according to the emotions.  According to the emotions the Supreme power is related to the devotee as a boss, son, father, mother, friend, child and so on.  However, all these <i>bhavanas</i> make the mind of the devotee to expand and this paves the way to understand the Reality.  An adherent devotee gradually moves to meditate the form.  He takes leave from concentrating on the celebrations of the rituals alone.  This is the point where the mind takes a turn towards the concept of Advaitam.  Meditation leads to Advaitam.  It is only a matter of time.  By meditating the form, the mind slowly assumes the concept behind that form and this gives a better understanding and knowledge about that Supreme power.  Through different stages of evolution of the mind an adherent devotee attains knowledge and realizes that everything is pervaded by God and He does not live in a far away distant place.  However, the knowledge about God must still go deeper and he has to realize that the Supreme power is none else than his Self.  This knowledge must become his experience.  Now he is no more confined in the idea that God can be limited by a form.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Dvaitam has to be followed until one gets well established in Advaitam.  Else he will be left in dark.  This is the reason that many Advaita <i>acharyas</i> like Sankaracharya, gave equal importance for the form worship also.  During the transition period from Dvaitam to Advaitam there will be a lot of confusion and turbulence, but one has to walk on the path forward boldly.  Ultimately, Advaitam can be practiced only by people with strong will and determination.  Only through Dvaitam one can reach Advaitam.  The basic concept of almost all the scriptures is Advaitam, though it is explained with the help of Dvaitam.  In Dvaitam, it is believed that God is responsible for all the actions and one is destined to carry out His orders, wheareas, in Advaitam only Consciousness remains, the rest is Maya.  When one transforms in to Advaitam, he cares less for the actions and become aware of his existence, Consciousness.  This is the reason that the Indian scriptures describe the <i>Brahma</i> <i>jhanis</i> as the persons who do not care for their appearance or actions.  He will not be aware of his external life.  He just lives to exhaust his karmas that had started to give fruits.  He is beyond the realm of the body, mind, and intellect.  The change in awareness from external to internal causes all the difference.    This change makes him perceive the world as Maya (illusion).  He realizes that Brahman pervades everything and That alone exists.  By this experience, the confusion and doubts in the mind are erased.  Until one reaches this knowledge, the facts in the scriptures appear as just imagination and assumption.  The scriptures are written by great sages who had devoted their life for the evolution of the mind.  They had passed through the different stages of mental evolution and established themselves in Reality.  Therefore, one must trust in the scriptures as it is and have faith in the words of the Guru to pass through the different stages of spirituality.  Even in the beginning stage itself, if we have doubt in the Reality, then it is impossible to reach the higher state.  The impatience in learning makes many to leave the practice halfway.  One must allow the mind to take natural transition.  One should not limit oneself in duality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In Advaitam there is no prayer or worship, because prayer or worship is done to a form which is assumed as different from the devotee.  Advaitam involves only understanding of the supreme knowledge.  There is no sentiment or emotion attached to Advaitam.  It is the state beyond the sense perception and mind.  Many will not have the opportunity to practice Advaitam because there are only few Advaita Gurus in the present time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Dvaitam and Advaitam are the two sides of a same coin.  The same person who has practiced Dvaitam in the early part of his life can practices Advaitam in the later period of life, just like Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa.  Until one reaches the highest state of Advaitam, the philosophies mingle with each other, and this should be carefully handled by the practitioner.  Just like a cocoon while passing from one leaf to the other holds the first leaf tightly till it settles on the new leaf, one must not leave Dvaitam till he establishes in Advaitam.  One philosophy cannot refute the other, because both of them are interdependent.  However the Reality is Advaitam, Brahman alone exists and the rest is Maya.</p>

					<p class="post-meta"> by <span class="author vcard"><a href="https://advaitamandscience.org/author/advaitamandscience/" title="Posts by advaitamandscience" rel="author">advaitamandscience</a></span> | <span class="published">Jun 13, 2014</span> | <a href="https://advaitamandscience.org/category/my-views/" rel="category tag">My Views</a></p>
<h4>                                                                           SUCCESS VERSUS VALUES</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Success is very important because only then positive values come to light; but is it good to ignore values to attain success.  Will the success have any value without positive values?  In the modern world, success is given prior importance and values take a back stage.  In the modern life, to succeed in all situations is more important than to follow one&#8217;s own values.  &#8220;&#8230;.keep your values positive, because your values become your destiny&#8221;, Mahatma Gandhi.  Almost in all fields, in today&#8217;s time, positive values are not given importance.  In the educational field, which is ought to be the basic field of development for the country, education is like high profile business.  Degrees are attained by students through improper channels.  What is the value of such degree?  Can a mere degree without in-depth knowledge in the subject bring development or real success to that person?  In the agricultural sector, people target the demands and not the quality.  This leads to multiple side effects and various health disorders.  The quality of the product is taken for granted.  Even in the medical profession, somehow the patients are treated and money is grabbed from them.  An individual is respected for the money and not for the real being.  So, in almost all the fields, positive values take a back stage.  Somehow, everyone wants to succeed in their chosen field.  In my view, everyone is born here with an ambition to succeed, but a success without any value is just another form of failure.  A nation as a whole cannot succeed without a hard earned success.  Such undignified successes pull down the nation as a whole.</p>
<p>A life without any values is the root cause for all kinds of corruption and malpractices.  Each individual has to lead their life according to their own positive values to make a nation successful.  To compete in this world normally one ignores others feelings and emotions.  It is better to remain as a person with failures than to achieve success without any values, because only a valuable success lasts long.  Success becomes useless and senseless when achieved by other means like bribing others or by influence and so on.  A successful person without any values will not have the needed knowledge to meet the required demands of that field and in the end he will be an unsuccessful person.  In the modern world, what is more ridiculous is, an individual following his own positive values is disrespected and ridiculed by others, and he is considered as an unsuccessful person.  If he does not follow the trend of the world, by respecting his values, then he is considered as a dull witted person.  If one does not stick to the values at all times, then they cannot be considered as values.  If one can attain anything by any means, then that success will not help either that individual or the society in due course of time.  Success achieved without any values changes the meaning of success itself.</p>
